@@31594514 A number of Old West gangs left a lasting impression on American history . While rare , the incidents were retold and embellished by dime novel and magazine authors during the late 19th century . The most notable shoot outs took place on the American frontier in Arizona , New Mexico , Kansas , Oklahoma , and Texas . Some like the Gunfight at the O.K.
