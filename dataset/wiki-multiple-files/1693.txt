Their clubhouse was burnt down on 8 November 2008. # History # The history of the G.A.A. in Edendork can be traced back much further than 1932 , the year in which the present St. Malachy 's club was formed . Indeed , it was only three years after the formation of the Gaelic Athletic Association that the game was first played in Edendork . The year was 1887 , and the match was probably the first ever in Tyrone . After a lapse of a few years , Gaelic football was revived at the turn of the century and continued sporadically though fervently for some thirty years at various locations in the district . Then in 1932 the present St. Malachy 's GFC was founded by Larry Fox and immediately joined the East Tyrone Junior League . In 1936 , Edendork won the league for the first tiime and reached the final of the East Tyrone Junior Championship , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made it two league titles in a row , and made it a hit-trick in 1938 , when they also won their first Tyrone title , the Junior Championship . The club won the league again in 1946 , before clinching another three-in-a-row of East Tyrone Junior League titles in 1950 , 1951 and 1952 . Edendork entered senior football for the first time the following season , and also fielded a hurling team . It was back to Junior , however , in 1957 , as emigration robbed the club of many of its leading players , but Edendork immediately made an impact by winning the Tyrone Junior Championship . Edendork returned to senior football with a vengeance in 1958 , just failing to reach the senior championship final in a thrilling semi-final against a Frankie Donnelly-inspired Carrickmore . There was little in the way of success for the next eight years , in fact the club dropped back into Junior football ; but in 1966 the team bounced back to Intermediate football with an unbeaten run to lift the league title . Edendork 's greatest success came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years later the club 's camogie team won the Tyrone league . Two of Edendork 's rising stars , Hugh Mooney and Kieran Currie won All-Ireland minor medals with Tyrone in 1973 , both playing vital roles in an historic victory . In 1976 , the camogie team achieved its greatest triumph by winning the Tyrone Senior Championship . 1982 saw the club 's Golden Jubilee and the publication of a book to mark this milestone , as well a series of celebratory events . Three years later , success returned on the field of play and Edendork lifted their second Intermediate Championship titlem and returned to senior football as double champions , having won the league as well . In the following season , the club 's greatest honour was witnessed all over the world , as two of our members played in the All-Ireland Final against Kerry at Croke Park . The Mallon brothers , Joe and Mickey , were members of the Tyrone team which came so close to bringing the Sam Maguire Cup home . Joe and Mickey both played heroic roles in that historic display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will live long in their minds and ours .
