It is bordered by Estonia , Lithuania , Russia , Belarus and by a maritime border to the west with Sweden . Latvia has 1,997,500 inhabitants and a territory of 64589km2 sqmi . The country has a temperate seasonal climate . Latvia is a democratic parliamentary republic established in 1918 . The capital city is Riga , the European Capital of Culture 2014 . Latvian is the official language . Latvia is a unitary state , divided into 118 administrative divisions of which 109 are municipalities and 9 are cities . There are five planning regions : Kurzeme , Latgale , Riga , Vidzeme and Zemgale . The Latvians are a Baltic people , culturally related to the Lithuanians . Latvians and Livs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language ; it and Lithuanian are the only two surviving Baltic languages . Despite foreign rule from the 13th to 20th centuries , the Latvian nation maintained its identity throughout the generations via the language and musical traditions . Latvia and Estonia share a long common history . As a consequence of the Soviet occupation both countries are home to a large number of ethnic Russians ( 26.9% in Latvia and 25.5% in Estonia ) , some of whom are non-citizens . Latvia is historically predominantly Protestant Lutheran , except for the Latgale region in the southeast , which has historically been predominantly Roman Catholic . The Republic of Latvia was founded on 18 November 1918 . However , its de facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II . In 1940 , the country was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union , invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941 , and re-occupied by the Soviets in 1944 to form the Latvian SSR for the next fifty years . The peaceful Singing Revolution , starting in 1987 , called for Baltic emancipation of Soviet rule . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Latvia declared the restoration of its de facto independence on 21 August 1991 . Latvia is a member of NATO , European Union , United Nations , Council of Europe , CBSS , IMF , NB8 , NIB , OSCE , and WTO . It is currently in the accession process for joining the OECD . For 2013 , Latvia is listed 44th on the Human Development Index and as a high income country . It used the Latvian lats as its currency until this was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2014. # Etymology # The name ' ' Latvija ' ' is derived from the name of the ancient Latgalians , one of four Indo-European Baltic tribes ( along with Couronians , Selonians and Semigallians ) , which formed the ethnic core of modern Latvians together with the Finnic Livonians. # History # Around 3000 BCE , the proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea . The Balts established trade routes to Rome and Byzantium , trading local amber for precious metals . By 900 CE , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selonians , Semigallians ( in Latvian : ' ' kuri ' ' , ' ' latgai ' ' , ' ' si ' ' and ' ' zemgai ' ' ) , as well as the Livonians ( ' ' lbiei ' ' ) speaking a Finnic language . # The Medieval period # Although the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries , they were more fully integrated into European society in the 12th century . The first missionaries , sent by the Pope , sailed up the Daugava River in the late 12th century , seeking converts . The local people , however , did not convert to Christianity as readily as hoped . German crusaders were sent into Latvia to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs by force of arms . In the beginning of the 13th century , large parts of today 's Latvia were ruled by Germans . Together with Southern Estonia , these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana or Livonia . In 1282 , Riga , and later the cities of Csis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanseatic League . and formed close cultural contacts with Western Europe . # The Reformation period # The 16th , 17th , and 18th centuries were a time of great change for the inhabitants of Latvia , including the reformation , the collapse of the Livonian state , and the time when the Latvian territory was divided up among foreign powers . After the Livonian War ( 15581583 ) , Livonia ( Latvia ) fell under Polish and Lithuanian rule . The southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the ' ' Ducatus Ultradunensis ' ' ( Prdaugavas hercogiste ) . Gotthard Kettler , the last Master of the Order of Livonia , formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia . Though the duchy was a vassal state to Poland , it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 17th century . Latgalia , the easternmost region of Latvia , became a part of the Polish district of Inflanty . The 17th and early 18th centuries saw a struggle between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern Baltic . After the PolishSwedish War ( 16001611 ) , northern Livonia ( including Vidzeme ) came under Swedish rule . Riga became the capital of Swedish Livonia and the largest city in the entire Swedish Empire . Fighting continued sporadically between Sweden and Poland until the Truce of Altmark in 1629 . In Latvia , the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive ; serfdom was eased , a network of schools was established for the peasantry , and the power of the regional barons was diminished . Several important cultural changes occurred during this time . Under Swedish and largely German rule , western Latvia adopted Lutheranism as its main religion . The ancient tribes of the Couronians , Semigallians , Selonians , Livs and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people , speaking one Latvian language . Throughout all the centuries , however , no such thing as a Latvian state existed so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective . Meanwhile , largely isolated from the rest of Latvia , southern Latgallians adopted Catholicism under Polish/Jesuit influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Polish and Russian loanwords. # Latvia in the Russian Empire ( 17101917 ) # The Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710 and the Treaty of Nystad , ending the Great Northern War in 1721 , gave Vidzeme to Russia ( it became part of the Governorate of Livonia During the Great Northern War ( 17001721 ) , up to 40 per cent of Latvians died from famine and plague . Half the residents of Riga were killed by plague in 17101711 . The promises Peter the Great made to the Baltic German nobility at the fall of Riga in 1710 , confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad and known as the Capitulations , largely reversed the Swedish reforms . Peter seriously considered moving Russian capital into Riga and visited Riga for several long stays ( he stayed in his own palace offered as a gift by Riga Magistrate together with keys from Riga ; palace purchased by him is still standing ; keys are exhibited in Moscow Kremlin museum ) .

In practice , however , the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility , as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation , forcing them to return to work at the estates of their own free will . During the 19th century , the social structure changed dramatically . A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land , but many landless peasants remained . There also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential Latvian bourgeoisie . The Young Latvian ( ) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century , many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order . The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the First National Awakening . Russification began in Latgale after the Polish led the January Uprising in 1863 : this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s . The Young Latvians were largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political movement , in the 1890s . Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution , which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces . During these two centuries Latvia experienced economic and construction boom ports were expanded ( Riga became the largest port in the Russian Empire ) , railways built ; new factories , banks and University were established ; many residential , public ( theatres and museums ) and school buildings erected ; new parks formed ; etc . Riga 's boulevards and streets with beautiful buildings outside the Old Town date from this period . # Declaration of Independence # World War I devastated the territory of what would become the state of Latvia , including other western parts of the Russian Empire . Demands for self-determination were at first confined to autonomy , but the Russian 1917 Revolution , treaty with Germany at Brest-Litovsk , and allied armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918 , created a power vacuum . The People 's Council of Latvia proclaimed the independence of the new country in Riga on 18 November 1918 , with Krlis Ulmanis becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe . By the spring of 1919 , there were actually three governmentsUlmanis 's government ; the Latvian Soviet government led by Pteris Stuka , whose forces , supported by the Red Army , occupied almost all of the country ; and the Baltic German government of the United Baltic Duchy , headed by Andrievs Niedra and supported by the Baltische Landeswehr and the German Freikorps unit ' ' Iron Division ' ' . Estonian and Latvian forces A freely elected Constituent assembly convened on 1 May 1920 , and adopted a liberal constitution , the ' ' Satversme ' ' , in February 1922 . The constitution was partly suspended by Krlis Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990 . Since then , it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today . With most of Latvia 's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915 , radical land reform was the central political question for the young state . In 1897 , 61.2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that percentage had been reduced to 18% . By 1923 , the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level . Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy , but it soon suffered from the effects of the Great Depression . Latvia showed signs of economic recovery , and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period . On 15 May 1934 , Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup , establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940 . After 1934 , Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of Latvianising the economy . # Latvia in World War II # Early in the morning of 24 August 1939 , the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact , called the MolotovRibbentrop Pact . The pact contained a secret protocol , revealed only after Germany 's defeat in 1945 , according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet spheres of influence . In the North , Latvia , Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective portions of Poland . After the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact , most of the Baltic Germans left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis ' government and Nazi Germany under the Heim ins Reich programme . In total 50,000 Baltic Germans left by the deadline of December 1939 , with 1,600 remaining to conclude business and 13,000 choosing to remain in Latvia . Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940 , when a second resettlement On 5 October 1939 , Latvia was forced to accept a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union , granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory . After staging border incidents , on 16 June 1940 the government of the USSR handed the Latvian ambassador in Moscow a note , in which Latvia was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 October 1939 , and demands were made for sending in additional Soviet troops and to change the government . The Latvian government capitulated in the face of overwhelming force . On 17 June Soviet troops invaded Latvian territory . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning . This is happening with the knowledge and consent of the government , which in turn stems from the amicable relations that exist between Latvia and the Soviet Union . It is , therefore , my wish that the residents of our country also show friendship towards the advancing military units .. The government has resigned . I shall remain in my place , you remain in yours . # No opposition was shown towards the Soviet forces ; on the contrary , part of the population accepted the news of their arrival with enthusiasm , which was heavily exploited by Soviet propaganda . The well known Russian lawyer and public figure of Latvia , Pyotr Yakobi , wrote : # Taken from the German model , the authoritarian beginning in our country has turned into a government of national bureaucracy , having satisfied a limited circle of citizens , who have adapted themselves to the state pie . Clearly , any hardship is not in vain . And so now the down-trodden have raised their voice and demand a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those unhappy with the regime of Krlis Ulmanis included people who were anxious about the deteriorating economic situation and had no desire to end up under Nazi German rule . State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres , in which 34,250 Latvians were deported or killed . Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions . The resulting people 's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR , which the Soviet Union granted . Latvia , then a puppet government , was headed by Augusts Kirhenteins . The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940 , as The ' ' Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic . ' ' The Soviets dealt harshly with their opponents prior to the German invasion , in less than a year , at least 27,586 people were arrested . Most were deported for cooperating with the German army , and about 945 were shot . Under German occupation , Latvia was administered as part of ' ' Reichskommissariat Ostland ' ' . Latvian paramilitary and Auxiliary Police units established by the occupation authority participated in the Holocaust as well . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including approximately 75,000 Latvian Jews murdered during the Nazi occupation . Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict , including in the Latvian Legion of the Waffen-SS , most of them conscripted by the occupying Nazi and Soviet authorities . # Soviet era ( 19401941 , 19441991 ) # In 1944 , when Soviet military advances reached the area , heavy fighting took place in Latvia between German and Soviet troops , which ended in another German defeat . In the course of the war , both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies , in this way increasing the loss of the nation 's live resources . In 1944 , part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control . The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system . After the German surrender , it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay , and Latvian national partisans , soon joined by German collaborators , began to fight against the new occupier . Anywhere from 120,000 to as many as 300,000 Latvians took refuge from the Soviet army by fleeing to Germany and Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with perhaps as many as 80,000 to 100,000 of them recaptured by the Soviets or , during few months immediately after the end of war , returned by the West . The Soviets reoccupied the country in 19441945 , and further deportations followed as the country was collectivised and Sovieticised . On 25 March 1949 , 43,000 rural residents ( kulaks ) and Latvian patriots ( nationalists ) were deported to Siberia in a sweeping Operation Priboi in all three Baltic states , which was carefully planned and approved in Moscow already on 29 January 1949 . An extensive programme to impose bilingualism was initiated in Latvia , limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favour of using Russian as the main language . All of the minority schools ( Jewish , Polish , Belorussian , Estonian , Lithuanian ) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools : Latvian and Russian . An influx of labourers , administrators , military personnel and their dependants from Russia and other Soviet republics started . By 1959 about 400,000 people arrived from other Soviet republics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists , Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union 's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia . New industry was created in Latvia , including a major machinery factory RAF in Jelgava , electrotechnical factories in Riga , chemical factories in Daugavpils , Valmiera and Olaineand some food and oil processing plants . Latvia manufactured trains , ships , minibuses , mopeds , telephones , radios and hi-fi systems , electrical and diesel engines , textiles , furniture , clothing , bags and luggage , shoes , musical instruments , home appliances , watches , tools and equipment , aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods . Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory ( LPs ) . However , there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories . To maintain and expand industrial production , skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union , decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic . Population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the 1980s , Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called glasnost and perestroika . In the summer of 1987 , the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monumenta symbol of independence . In the summer of 1988 , a national movement , coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia , was opposed by the Interfront . The Latvian SSR , along with the other Baltic Republics was allowed greater autonomy , and in 1988 , the old pre-war Flag of Latvia flew again , replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990 . In 1989 , the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a resolution on the ' ' Occupation of the Baltic states ' ' , in which it declared the occupation not in accordance with law , and not the will of the Soviet people . Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 1990 democratic elections . On 4 May 1990 , the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic of Latvia , and the Latvian SSR was renamed Republic of Latvia . However , the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991 . In January 1991 , Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions . During the transitional period , Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia . In spite of this , 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991 , in a nonbinding advisory referendum . The Popular Front of Latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship . However , universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted . A majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship . Many of them were born in Latvia , but still became non-citizens . By 2011 , more than half of non-citizens had taken naturalisation exams and received Latvian citizenship . Still , today there are 290,660 non-citizens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no citizenship of any country , and can not vote in Latvia . The Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 August 1991 , in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt . The Saeima , Latvia 's parliament , was again elected in 1993 . Russia ended its military presence by completing its troop withdrawal in 1994 and shutting down the Skrunda-1 radar station in 1998 . The major goals of Latvia in the 1990s , to join NATO and the European Union , were achieved in 2004 . Language and citizenship laws have been opposed by many Russophones . Citizenship was not automatically extended to former Soviet citizens who settled during the Soviet occupation , or to their offspring . Children born to non-nationals after the reestablishment of independence are automatically entitled to citizenship . Approximately 72% of Latvian citizens are Latvian , while 20% are Russian ; less than 1% of non-citizens are Latvian , while 71% are Russian .

On 1 January 2014 , the Euro became the country 's currency , superseding the Lats . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of the euro , while 52% opposed it . Following the introduction of the Euro , Eurobarometer surveys in January 2014 showed support for the Euro to be around 53% , close to the European average . Since the year 2000 , Latvia has had one of the highest ( GDP ) growth rates in Europe . However , the chiefly consumption-driven growth in Latvia resulted in the collapse of the Latvian GDP in late 2008 and early 2009 , exacerbated by the global economic crisis , shortage of credit and huge money resources needed for bailout of Parex bank . Latvian economy fell 18% in the first three months of 2009 , the biggest fall in the European Union . The economic crisis of 2009 proved earlier assumptions that the fast growing economy was heading for implosion of the economic bubble , because it was driven mainly by growth of domestic consumption , financed by a serious increase of private debt , as well as a negative foreign trade balance . The prices of real estate , which were at some points appreciating at approximately 5% a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , which mainly produces low-value goods and raw materials . Privatisation in Latvia is almost complete . Virtually all of the previously state-owned small and medium companies have been privatised , leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies . The private sector accounted for nearly 68% of the country 's GDP in 2000 . Foreign investment in Latvia is still modest compared with the levels in north-central Europe . A law expanding the scope for selling land , including to foreigners , was passed in 1997 . Representing 10.2% of Latvia 's total foreign direct investment , American companies invested $127 million in 1999 . In the same year , the United States of America exported $58.2 million of goods and services to Latvia and imported $87.9 million . Eager to join Western economic institutions like the World Trade Organisation , OECD , and the European Union , Latvia signed a Europe Agreement with the EU in 1995with a 4-year transition period . Latvia and the United States have signed treaties on investment , trade , and intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latvian economy entered a phase of fiscal contraction during the second half of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and unrealistic appreciation in real estate values . The national account deficit for 2007 , for example , represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while inflation was running at 10% . Latvia 's unemployment rate rose sharply in this period from a low of 5.4% in November 2007 to over 22% . In April 2010 Latvia had the highest unemployment rate in the EU , at 22.5% , ahead of Spain , which had 19.7% . Paul Krugman , the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008 , wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed column on 15 December 2008 : : The most acute problems are on Europes periphery , where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America and Asia : Latvia is the new Argentina However , by 2010 , commentators noted signs of stabilisation in the Latvian economy . Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor 's raised its outlook on Latvia 's debt from negative to stable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 27% in late 2006 was in surplus in February 2010 . Kenneth Orchard , senior analyst at Moody 's Investors Service argued that : : The strengthening regional economy is supporting Latvian production and exports , while the sharp swing in the current account balance suggests that the countrys internal devaluation is working . The IMF concluded the First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with the Republic of Latvia in July 2012 announcing that Latvias economy has been recovering strongly since 2010 , following the deep downturn in 200809 . Real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2011 was underpinned by export growth and a recovery in domestic demand . The growth momentum has continued into 2012 and 2013 despite deteriorating external conditions , and the economy is expected to expand by 4.1 percent in 2014 . The unemployment rate has receded from its peak of more than 20 percent in 2010 to around 9.3 percent in 2014. # Infrastructure # The transport sector is around 14% of GDP . Transit between Russia , Belarus , Kazakhstan as well as other Asian countries and the West is large . Three biggest ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liepja . Most transit traffic uses these and half the cargo is crude oil and oil products . Free port of Ventspils is the busiest port in the Baltic states . Apart from road and railway connections , Ventspils is also linked to oil extraction fields and transportation routes of Russian Federation via system of two pipelines from Polotsk , Belarus . Riga International Airport is the busiest airport in the Baltic states with 4.7 million passengers in 2012 . It has direct flight to over 80 destinations in 30 countries . airBaltic is the Latvian flag carrier airline and a low-cost carrier . Latvia has three big hydroelectric power stations in Paviu HE S ( 825MW ) , Rgas HE S ( 402 MW ) and eguma HES-2 ( 192 MW ) . In the recent years a couple of dozen of wind farms as well as biogas or biomass power stations of different scale have been built in Latvia . Latvia operates Inukalns underground gas storage facility , one of the largest underground gas storage facilities in Europe and the only one in the Baltic states . Unique geological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable for underground gas storage . # Demographics # The total fertility rate ( TFR ) in 2013 was estimated at 1.34 children born/woman , which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1 . In 2012 , 45.0% of births were to unmarried women . The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 73.19 years ( 68.13 years male , 78.53 years female ) . # Ethnic groups # Latvia 's population has been multiethnic for centuries , though the demographics shifted dramatically in the 20th century due to the World Wars , the emigration and removal of Baltic Germans , the Holocaust , and occupation by the Soviet Union . According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897 , Latvians formed 68.3% of the total population of 1.93 million ; Russians accounted for 12% , Jews for 7.4% , Germans for 6.2% , and Poles for 3.4% .

There were 290,660 non-citizens living in Latvia or 14.1% of Latvian residents , mainly ethnic Russians who arrived after the occupation of 1940 and their descendants . In some cities , e.g. Daugavpils and Rzekne , ethnic Latvians constitute a minority of the total population . Despite the fact that the proportion of ethnic Latvians has been steadily increasing for more than a decade , ethnic Latvians also make up slightly less than a half of the population of the capital city of Latvia Rga . The share of ethnic Latvians had fallen from 77% ( 1,467,035 ) in 1935 to 52% ( 1,387,757 ) in 1989 . In 2011 there were even fewer Latvians than in 1989 , though their share of the population was larger 1,284,194 ( 62.1% of the population ) . # Language # The sole official language of Latvia is Latvian , which belongs to the Baltic language group of the Indo-European language family . Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct Livonian language of the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or distinct separate language of Latvian is also formally protected by Latvian law but only as a historical variation of the Latvian language . Russian , which was widely spoken during the Soviet period , is still the most widely used minority language by far ( about 34% speak it at home , including persons who are not ethnically Russian ) . While it is now required that all school students learn Latvian , most schools also include English and either German or Russian in their curricula . The English language is widely accepted in Latvia , especially in business and tourism . As of 2014 there are 109 schools for minorities that use Russian as the language of instruction for 40% of subjects ( the rest 60% of subjects are taught in Latvian ) , however Latvian government is planning to completely abolish Russian as the language of instruction by 2018 . On 18 February 2012 , Latvia held a constitutional referendum on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language . According to the Central Election Commission , 74.8% voted against , 24.88% voted for and the voter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latvia 's Russian speaking community ( 290,660 or 14.1% of Latvia 's entire population ) could not vote in this referendum because they hold non-citizen status and thus have no right to vote . # Religion # The largest religion in Latvia is Christianity , though only about 7% of the population attends religious services regularly . The largest groups as of 2011 were : * Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia 708,773 *Russian Orthodox 370,000 The country 's Orthodox Christians belong to the Latvian Orthodox Church , a semi-autonomous body within the Russian Orthodox Church . In 2011 , there were 416 Jews and 319 Muslims living in Latvia . There are more than 600 Latvian neopagans , ' ' Dievturi ' ' ( The Godskeepers ) , whose religion is based on Latvian mythology . About 21% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion . # Education # Riga Technical University and University of Latvia are two major universities in the country , both been established on the basis of Riga Polytechnical Institute and located in Riga . Another two important universities , which were established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latvia University of Agriculture ( established in 1939 on the basis of the Faculty of Agriculture ) and Riga Stradi University ( established in 1950 on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine ) both nowadays cover a variety of different fields . Daugavpils University is another significant centre of education . Latvia closed 131 schools between 2006 and 2010 , which is a 12.9% decline , and in the same period enrolment in educational institutions has fallen by over 54,000 people , a 10.3% decline . # Health # The Latvian healthcare system is a universal programme , largely funded through government taxation . It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe , due to excessive waiting times for treatment , insufficient access to the latest medicines , and other factors . There were 59 hospitals in Latvia in 2009 , down from 94 in 2007 , and 121 in 2006 . Corruption is relatively widespread in the Latvian healthcare system , though the situation has improved since the early 1990s . It has been noted that an environment conducive to corruption has been promulgated by low salaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain , mostly to Western EU nations . As of 2009 , there were approximately 8,600 inhabitants of Latvia living with HIV/AIDS , accounting for a 0.7% adult HIV prevalence rate . There were 32,376 ( 1.44% ) individual instances of clinically reported alcoholism in Latvia in 2008 , as well as cases of addictions to other substances . The annual number of births per 1,000 adolescent women aged 15 to 19 has declined from 49.9 in 1990 to 17.9 in 2007 . In 2005 , Latvia had a suicide rate of 24.5 per 100,000 inhabitants ( down from 40.7 in 1995 ) , the 7th highest in the world . # Culture # Traditional Latvian folklore , especially the dance of the folk songs , date back well over a thousand years . More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 melodies of folk songs have been identified . Between the 13th and 19th centuries , Baltic Germans , many of whom were originally of non-German ancestry but had been assimilated into German culture , formed the upper class . They developed distinct cultural heritage , characterised by both Latvian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day , in spite of their dispersal to Germany , the USA , Canada and other countries in the early 20th century . However , most indigenous Latvians did not participate in this particular cultural life . Thus , the mostly peasant local pagan heritage was preserved , partly merging with Christian traditions . For example , one of the most popular celebrations is Ji , a pagan celebration of the summer solsticewhich Latvians celebrate on the feast day of St. John the Baptist . In the 19th century , Latvian nationalist movements emerged . They promoted Latvian culture and encouraged Latvians to take part in cultural activities . The 19th century and beginning of the 20th century is often regarded as a classical era of Latvian culture . Posters show the influence of other European cultures , for example , works of artists such as the Baltic-German artist Bernhard Borchert and the French Raoul Dufy . With the onset of World War II , many Latvian artists and other members of the cultural elite fled the country yet continued to produce their work , largely for a Latvian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important event in Latvian culture and social life . It has been held since 1873 , normally every five years . Approximately 30,000 performers altogether participate in the event . Although usually folksongs and classical choir songs are sung , with emphasis on a cappella singing , recently modern popular songs have been incorporated into the repertoire as well . After incorporation into the Soviet Union , Latvian artists and writers were forced to follow the Socialist realism style of art . During the Soviet era , music became increasingly popular , with the most popular being songs from the 1980s . At this time , songs often made fun of the characteristics of Soviet life and were concerned about preserving Latvian identity . This aroused popular protests against the USSR and also gave rise to an increasing popularity of poetry . Since independence , theatre , scenography , choir During July 2014 , Riga will host the 8th World Choir Games as it plays host to over 27 000 choristers representing over 450 choirs and over 70 countries .
