@@205514 birthplace = Hamburg , Holy Roman Empire Johann Franz Encke ( 23 September 1791 26 August 1865 ) was a German astronomer . Among his activities , he worked on the calculation of the periods of comets and asteroids , measured the distance from the earth to the sun , and made observations of the planet Saturn . # Biography # Encke was born in Hamburg , where his father was a clergyman at the Jakobskirche . He was the youngest of eight children - when his father died when he was four , the family in straitened circumstances . Thanks to the financial assistance of a teacher , he was able to be educated at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums . He studied mathematics and astronomy from 1811 at the University of Gttingen under Carl Friedrich Gauss ; but he enlisted in the Hanseatic Legion for the campaign of 18131814 , serving as a sergeant in the artillery of the Prussian army , in Holstein and Mecklenburg . In 1814 he resumed his studies at the University but after Napoleon 's escape from Elba he returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a lieutenant . Having returned to Gttingen in 1816 , he was at once appointed by Bernhardt von Lindenau as his assistant in the observatory of Seeberg near Gotha ( he had become acquainted with von Lindenau during his military service ) . There he completed his investigation of the comet of 1680 , for which the Cotta prize was awarded to him in 1817 by judges Gauss and Olbers ; he correctly assigned a period of 71 years to the comet of 1812 . That comet is now called ' ' 12P/Pons-Brooks ' ' . Following a suggestion by Jean-Louis Pons , who suspected one of the three comets discovered in 1818 to be the same one already discovered by him in 1805 , Encke began to calculate the orbital elements of this comet . At this time , all the known comets had an orbital period of seventy years and more , with an aphelion far beyond the orbit of Uranus . The most famous comet of this family was Comet Halley with its period of seventy-six years . So the orbit of the comet discovered by Pons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a period of 3.3 years , so that the aphelion had to be within the orbit of Jupiter . Encke predicted its return for 1822 , but this return was observable only from the southern hemisphere and was seen by Carl Ludwig Christian Rmker in Australia . The comet was also identified with the one seen by Pierre Mchain in 1786 and by Caroline Herschel in 1795 . Encke sent his calculations as a note to Gauss , Olbers , and Bessel . His former mathematics professor published this note and Encke became famous as the discoverer of the short periodic comets . The first object of this family , the Encke comet , was named after him and so it is one of the few comets not named after the discoverer , but after the one who calculated the orbit . Later this comet was identified as the origin of the Taurids meteor showers . The importance of the predicted return based on the calculation by Encke was rewarded by the Royal Astronomical Society in London by presenting their Gold Medal to him in 1824 .

In 1825 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society . Eight masterly treatises on the comet 's movements were published by him in the ' ' Berliner Abhandlungen ' ' ( 18291859 ) . From a fresh discussion of the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 he deduced a solar parallax of 8.57 arcsecond . This and the corresponding distance to the sun were long accepted as authoritative . His results were published in two separate tracts , entitled ' ' Die Entfernung der Sonne ' ' ( The distance to the sun , 1822-1824 ) . In 1822 he became director of the Seeberg observatory , and in 1825 was promoted to a corresponding position at Berlin , where a new observatory , built under his superintendence and with the support of Alexander von Humboldt and King Frederick William III of Prussia , was inaugurated in 1835 .

Within the following time Encke was involved in the discovery and orbital parameter determination of other short periodic comets and asteroids . In 1837 , Encke described a broad variation in the brightness of the A Ring of Saturn . The Encke Gap was later named in honor of his observations of Saturn 's rings . In 1844 , Encke became professor for astronomy at the University of Berlin . Much labor was bestowed by him upon facilitating the computation of the movements of the asteroids . With this end in view he expounded to the Berlin Academy in 1849 a mode of determining an elliptic orbit from three observations , and communicated to that body in 1851 a new method of calculating planetary perturbations by means of rectangular coordinates ( republished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' , No. 141 , 1903 ) . Encke visited England in 1840 . He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1836 . Incipient brain-disease compelled him to withdraw from official life in November 1863 . He still was director of the Berlin observatory until his death on 26 August 1865 in Spandau . His successor was Wilhelm Julius Foerster . He contributed extensively to the periodical literature of astronomy . Encke 's grave is preserved at a cemetery in the Kreuzberg section of Berlin , the ' ' Friedhof II der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde ' ' ( Cemetery No . II of the congregations of Jerusalem 's Church and New Church ) ( entrance : opposite to 58-60 , Zossener Str. ; 61 , Baruther Street only for vehicles of the cemetery ) . His grave is close to that of the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. # Honors # *Twice , in 1824 and 1830 , the recipient of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society . *The crater Encke on the Moon is named after him . *The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Encke gap of Saturn 's rings is named after him . *The Comet Encke is named after him for his calculation of its orbit . # Notes #
