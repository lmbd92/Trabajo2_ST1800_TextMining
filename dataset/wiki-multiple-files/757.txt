@@3382514 Bernard Budiansky ( 19251999 ) was a renowned scholar in the field of applied mechanics , and made seminal contributions to the mechanics of structures and mechanics of materials . He was a recipient of the Timoshenko Medal . # Biography # Budiansky was born in New York City on March 8 , 1925 , to Russian immigrant parents . Upon obtaining a Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree from City College of New York in 1944 when he was barely over 19 , he became an aeronautical research scientist at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA , forerunner to NASA ) at Langley Field , Virginia . He took an educational leave from NACA to enroll in 1947 in the graduate program in Applied Mathematics at Brown University , completing his Ph.D . in 1950 . He returned to Langley in 1950 and , in 1952 , was appointed Head of the Structural Mechanics Branch . He joined the faculty of Harvard in 1955 . He made widely cited contributions on the way that fissures and joints in rocks affect the propagation of seismic waves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Earth , and contributed to understanding stressing and deformation in the inflation of the human lung . His work of the later years was focused on problems in the domain of materials science , explaining mechanical properties of solids in terms of microscopic mechanisms . He referred to this important area as micromechanics . He was one of its pioneers , and contributed to explanation of the fracture of ductile metals and the toughening of normally brittle ceramics and composite materials . Budiansky won many honors including the AIAA 1970 Dryden Research Lecturer ; CCNY 1974 Townsend Harris Medal ; ASCE 1982 von Karman Medal ; Society of Engineering Science 1985 Eringen Medal ; ASME 1989 Timoshenko Medal . He received honorary doctorates from Northwestern University 1986 and Technion Israel Institute of Technology . In addition he was a member of the National Academy of Sciences , the National Academy of Engineering , the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ; the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Science ; and the Danish Center for Applied Mathematics and Mechanics . Professional affiliations included : ASCE , ASME , AIAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 , at his home in Lexington , Massachusetts , aged 73. # Doctoral degree # *Brown University , 1950 *Title of thesis : Fundamental Theorems and Consequences of the Slip Theory of Plasticity *Advisor : William Prager
