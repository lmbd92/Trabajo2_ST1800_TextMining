The album features guest appearances from Roc Marciano , Oh No , Ghostface Killah , Action Bronson , Cappadonna and Vinnie Paz . The albums production comes from 7L , Spada4 and DJ Premier . # Background # In February 2013 , during an interview with HipHopDX , Inspectah Deck spoke about the origins of the album , saying : I really do nt think there were a lot of goals or things like that . For me right now , its taking off better than anticipated because I guess I underestimated the peoples need to hear something worth listening to . So I did ' ' CZARFACE ' ' , Ive done a couple records with 7L &amp; Esoteric back in the day with Speaking Real Words and another 12th Chamber . Ive done two songs with them already , and we built up a lot of buzz just off of those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tour with the Wu-Tang Clan , but we all talked about it a while agoabout doing this type of project . It all just came together at the right time , and the whole ' ' CZARFACE ' ' thing was supposed to be a hero to save Hip Hop . I did nt really have the whole cartoon , comic book vision all in my head at that time . I sat down with Esoteric , he brought that thought to light and I thought that would be a good idea . A lot of the real Hip Hop heads , the true school Hip Hop generation , they know what that covers all about . We grew up with those comic books , some of us are still die-hard fans of that , and I thought bringing that together with just being the classic Hip Hop beats and rhymes of the ' 90s and before . I thought that combination was going to bring something to the game . I think ' ' CZARFACE ' ' is the blue-collar album of Rap right now . I think its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Wallace and them . They really had no star but the whole team was blue-collar , and everybody gave that effort . I think this is one of those underdog albums that , when the smoke clears from all of those big guns going off , youre still going to hear these shots going . I listened to the project really head-to-toe for the first time the other day and Im like , It sounds good man . Just let it play from beginning to end , thats how we used to do when we had cassette tapes ; just let it roll then go to the other side . I think this is one of those personally , just listening to the sound I think . We leaked three songsthe one with Roc Marciano Cement 3 's , the one with Action Bronson Its Raw and the one Shoguns with Vinnie Paz . I believe that created a real buzz for it right now , so its getting good feedback and a good vibe . I think this is one of the smart choices for 2013 . Esoteric also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Basically it started out as 7Ls idea to put out something like a white label or kind of a diamond in the rough slab of vinyl that really had no promotion at all and was just kind of leaked out there . You know we still have that ' 90s mentality . With me and Inspectah Deck on the mic and 7L on production , we were just going to have it sneak out . As we started recording , we thought we could actually sell this , so we started to conceptualize the idea of ' ' CZARFACE ' ' and having that be the name of the group . The character represents the three of us when were on the mic and doing damage or whatever . The idea was to make a few records , keep it really lyrical and give the people what they wanted and expect from the Wu-Tang Clans most heralded swordsman so to speak , and me and 7L from Boston . So it was just doing what we do in the past but just come out swinging in 2013 . # Esoteric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : # It was just important for us to work with lyricists that we respect and just keep it a really organic record . Were not trying to dial in an Akon hook or something like that thats going to make a record blow up in a way that does nt really suit us . I think the natural thing to do is to get some Wu members , some members from my crewweve got Vinnie Paz on the record . Everyone was really excited and easy to work with because they saw our vision . Obviously the Wu guys with an allegiance to Deck just made it a real easy thing . And 7L wanted to get Action Bronson and Roc Marciano on the record cause these guys are really poppin right now . It might add a little flavor to the record for maybe a younger listener who is more in-tuned to what theyre doing right now , and obviously they destroyed it . I have a tremendous amount of respect for them , so it was just a good fit for the album . # Esoteric also spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well that was something that I wanted to do for the album . One of the things that always stood out to me with Deck was that hed reference superheroes every once in a whilesomething about the claws of Wolverine , Peter Parkerall these different things . Ive always been into comic books , and I think our discography kind of shows everything with that . But I kinda think thats how we meet too , and if we had a figurehead for the album , I came up with ' ' CZARFACE ' ' the name . I ran it by Deck , and he loved it , and then I had to find an artist that kind of brings ' ' CZARFACE ' ' to life . I wanted it to be very Jack Kirby influenced . I just love Jack Kirbys art . Lamour Supreme , who works for Mishka , had done stuff for Jack Kirbys museum , and it made a lot of sense for him to do the art and he killed it . He developed ' ' CZARFACE ' ' based on the ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to look like and what he represented . I would reference Ultron and Major Blood and all these different metal-clad villains or heroes , and he just went with it . Were really happy with what he created . # Critical response # ' ' Czarface ' ' was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 78 , based on 6 reviews , which indicates positive reviews . Omar Burgess of HipHopDX gave the album four out of five stars , saying ' ' CZARFACE ' ' has no major flaws . Its obviously not for everyone , yet even when incorporating current critical favorites like Action Bronson and Mr. MFN eXquire , no compromises are made . Inspectah Deck , 7L &amp; Esoteric use ' 90s East Coast Hip Hop as a blueprint to innovate , and ultimately , thats what made that era so special in the first place . Bogar Alonso of ' ' XXL ' ' gave the album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed last golden era , might make some queeze , and for good reason . Hip-hop purists have long sucked on the decade like a warm thumb , afraid of the cold , mean world that lay ahead . But ' ' CZARFACE ' ' , also the name for Deck and co. s group , keeps matters as fresh . The albums marqueewith names like Roc Marciano , Action Bronson , and Mr. MFN eXquireassures just that . Cement 3s , Its Raw , and Poisonous Thoughtslisted in the order of appearance of the guests mentionedcome off as love letters rather than industry rub-offs . If the above trio were operating in the late 90s , theyd be dropping similar heat . Bryan Hahn of ' ' The Source ' ' gave the album a positive review , saying ' ' Czarface ' ' does n't fall short of what it wanted to accomplish-knocking the chumps out the ring . It does n't pretend to deliver positive messages for the kids or even tell heart wrenching stories about the hood . Plain and simple , 7L masterminded sinister beats while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential of the often-mislead art of lyricism can sound like . Long live , ' ' Czarface ' ' . Matthew Fiander of PopMatters gave the album a six out of ten , saying Song to song we see confident production and expert rhyming from guys we know can do both . But while Inspectah Deck may be one of the most effortless emcees in Wu-Tang , he s not the most narrative . Neither is Esoteric . So while the songs here bang in all the ways you want , they rarely catch you off guard and they rarely tell you where theyre going . Not that they need to , but that sense of direction , out of the past and toward something new , might have elevated a good album to something great . Mark Bozzer of ' ' Exclaim ! ' ' gave the album a seven out of ten , saying Minus all of the corny sound bites , this album undoubtedly keeps the underground renaissance sizzling . # Commercial performance # The album debuted at number 34 on the US Billboard Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listing #
