' ' Islay ' ' , however , is the only work of his that was published . He was the president of the Florida Association of the Deaf for some time . # Writing Style # ' ' Islay ' ' is written an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English , while there is a written gloss form of American Sign Language that is used for dialogue between characters . This gloss form of ASL is written in italics and is neither truly English nor truly ASL . An example of this gloss form , coming from Lyson about his desire for a homeland for the Deaf is as follows : ' ' You know that Laurent Clerc had same dream . Himself greatest deaf in history , started Golden Age for deaf there France . Then brought sign here America ; almost started new Golden Age for us deaf , but hearing oralism frustrated him , broke up deaf cooperation and almost destroyed Sign Language . That why Clerc liked idea for deaf gathering into one state where deaf itself normal ! ' ' ( 6-7 ) . If the reader is a signer of ASL , they can see that the way this gloss form is written shows word order of ASL signs .

There are also parts of the novel written in bold capital letters that are used to describe conversations through a TTY . An example of this writing form is as follows : MARY HERE . WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN Q. I WAITED SINCE SIX . DISGUSTED GA . ( 67 ) . When using a TTY , the ' Q ' after a sentence makes it a question . ' GA ' means go ahead , which informs the person on the other line that you are done talking and they can type their response .

If one has a background in American Sign Language and is familiar with TTYs , they will more easily understand the glossed form of ASL and the TTY text . # Title Meaning # When the book was first released , there was much talk about what the title meant . Some people speculated it was a mix of the finger spelled acronyms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ASL ) while others hypothesized it was derived from island .
