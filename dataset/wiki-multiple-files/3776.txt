@@35840514 ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' is an uncommon species of fungus found in association with willow in Europe . The species produces small , brown or yellow mushrooms with caps up to 2.5cm 1 across , with stems up to 3.5 cm long . The species is similar in appearance to several other closely related species in the genus ' ' Inocybe ' ' that also associate with willow , and so is most reliably differentiated microscopically. # Taxonomy and phylogeny # ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' was described and named by Robert Khner in 1955 in the ' ' Bulletin Trimestriel de la Socit Mycologique de France ' ' . ' ' Inocybe straminipes ' ' is a synonym of ' ' I. salicis ' ' . The former was originally described in 1979 by Henri Romagnesi , and had different spores from those of ' ' I. salicis ' ' . However , the holotype was reexamined in 2009 by Ukka Vauras and Katri Kokkonen , who observed that the spores were in fact identical to those of ' ' I. salicis ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The specific epithet ' ' salicis ' ' is in reference to ' ' Salix ' ' , the generic name for willow . Within the genus ' ' Inocybe ' ' , ' ' I. salicis ' ' belongs to the section ' ' Marginatae ' ' , which also includes ' ' I. obtusiuscula ' ' , ' ' I. dunensis ' ' , ' ' I. salicis-herbaceae ' ' , ' ' I. substellata ' ' , ' ' I. praetervisa ' ' , ' ' I. saliceticola ' ' and ' ' I. mixtilis ' ' . These species are all known to associate with willow , and all have macroscopic similarities . As such , they are best differentiated microscopically. # Description # ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' mushrooms have tawny to yellowish-brown caps of between 1and2.5cm in in diameter . Their surface can be cracked , covered in fibres or scaly . The caps change in shape as the mushrooms mature ; while younger specimens have campanulate ( bell-shaped ) to conical caps , the caps of older specimens expand and flatten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cutis . The gills are almost free , meaning that they only just connect to the stem , and are initially a pale grey , becoming an ochre-grey ( or brownish ) as they age . The stem has a white to honey-coloured surface entirely covered in powdery granules . The stem is 1.5to3.5cm in long by 0.4to1cm in thick . There is a well-defined bulb at the base of the stem . The white flesh smells spermatic , but the scent is not distinctive . # Microscopic characteristics # ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' produces spores of 9 to 11 by 6 to 8 micrometers ( m ) . In shape , they are elongated or curved , but they are covered with 10 to 15 distinctive blunt , semi-circular projections . The cystidia on the face and edge of the gills measure 50 to 70 by 12 to 25 m with a cell wall 2 to 3 m thick , and either taper at each end , or are shaped like swollen bottles , with the cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) more variable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are club- or balloon-shaped , and caulocystidia can be found all the way down the stem . # Distribution and habitat # ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' favours wet land in willow woodland and clearings . Although widespread throughout its range in Europe , it is not commonly encountered .
