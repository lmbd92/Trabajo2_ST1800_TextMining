He was interviewed for the position of Solicitor General of the United States , but the position went to Rex E. Lee , to Scalia 's great disappointment . Scalia was offered a seat on the Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in early 1982 , but declined it , hoping to be appointed to the highly influential United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ( D.C. Circuit ) . Later that year , Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit , which Scalia accepted .

Scalia has taken a broad view of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution # Individual rights # # #Abortion# # Scalia has argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion , and that if the people desire legalized abortion , a law should be passed to accomplish it . Scalia wrote in his dissenting opinion in the 1992 case of ' ' Planned Parenthood v. Casey ' ' , # The States may , if they wish , permit abortion on demand , but the Constitution does not require them to do so . The permissibility of abortion , and the limitations upon it , are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy : by citizens trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found thermal imaging of a home to be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment .

Uncomfortable with the changes brought about following Vatican II , Scalia regularly attends the Tridentine Latin Mass in both Chicago and Washington , and has driven long distances to parishes that he felt were more in accord with his beliefs . In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for ' ' New York ' ' magazine , Scalia was asked if his beliefs extended to the Devil , Scalia stated , Of course ! Yeah , he 's a real person . Hey , c'm on , that 's standard Catholic doctrine ! Every Catholic believes that . When asked if he had seen recent evidence of the Devil , Scalia replied , You know , it is curious .

In another 2013 interview , Scalia stated that In order for capitalism to work , in order for it to produce a good and stable society , traditional Christian virtues are essential . In 2006 , Scalia , approached by a reporter upon leaving church , was asked if being a traditional Catholic had caused problems for him . He responded by asking , You know what I say to those people ? , and with a gesture , cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out . The gesture , which was captured by a photographer , was initially reported by the ' ' Boston Herald ' ' as obscene . Scalia responded to the reports with a letter to the editor accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of ' ' The Sopranos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush-off . Roger Axtell , an expert on body language , described the gesture as possibly meaning I 've had enough , go away and noted , It 's a fairly strong gesture . # Assessment # In 2009 , after nearly a quarter century on the Court , Scalia characterized his victories as damn few . His biographer , Joan Biskupic , speculated that Scalia , health permitting , might remain on the Court for another decade . Writing in ' ' The Forward ' ' , J.J. Goldberg described Scalia as the intellectual anchor of the court 's conservative majority . <ref> Citation Whereas he is widely admired among conservatives , many liberals dislike his views . In March 2009 , openly gay Congressman Barney Frank described him as a homophobe . <ref> Citation Rossum , writing in 2006 , before George W.

Maggs suggested , # With Justice Scalia breathing down the necks of anyone who peeks into the Congressional Record or Senate reports , the other members of the Court may have concluded that the benefit of citing legislative history does not outweigh its costs . It is likely for this reason that the percentage of cases citing it has decreased dramatically . No one likes an unnecessary fight , especially not one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia. # # Works # * Scalia , Antonin , and Gutmann , Amy , ed. , ( 1997 ) ' ' A Matter of Interpretation : Federal Courts and the Law ' ' ( Princeton N.J. : Princeton University Press ) ISBN 0-691-00400-5. * Scalia , Antonin ; Garner , Bryan A.
