@@1714514 runtime = 94 minutes ' ' Incident at Loch Ness ' ' is a 2004 mockumentary starring , produced by and written by Werner Herzog and Zak Penn . The small cast film follows Herzog and his crew ( Gabriel Beristain , Russell Williams II ) while working on the production of a movie project on the Loch Ness Monster entitled ' ' Enigma of Loch Ness ' ' . It won the New American Cinema Award at the 2004 Seattle International Film Festival . # Plot # After a mysterious shot of a body floating in Loch Ness ( reprised near the end ) , ' ' Incident at Loch Ness ' ' flashes back to the beginning of a documentary called ' ' Herzog In Wonderland ' ' being directed by John Bailey with an overview of Herzog 's work as he himself begins work for a separate documentary to be called ' ' Enigma of Loch Ness ' ' , in which he is exploring the Loch Ness Monster myth . Throughout the film , Herzog asserts the Loch Ness Monster is merely a creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film continues , Herzog hosts a dinner party to kick off film production . In attendance are his wife ( Lena Herzog ) , several Hollywood celebrities ( Jeff Goldblum , Ricky Jay ) , and the film 's crew . Difficulties begin to arise as the untested producer , Zak Penn , attempts to transform Herzog 's film into a high-grossing blockbuster . In this attempt , Penn commits several Hollywood clichs such as hiring a beautiful woman ( Kitana Baker ) for a dubious role as a sonar operator and a self-deluded cryptozoologist ( Michael Karnow ) for comic relief . As the shooting progresses , the tension between Herzog and Penn escalates with each revelation that Penn is acting in an underhanded manner . First , it becomes quite apparent the producer has commissioned a fake Nessie to be used . Then both Kitana and Karnow are revealed to be actors hired by Penn . In a twist of events , when Herzog and his crew are working on their film , the crew begins to see what appears to truly be the Loch Ness Monster .

The crew huddles below decks until the monster returns again to ram the boat hard enough to cause it to begin to sink . Karnow is thrown overboard during another attack , Nessie now clearly visible to the crew . Karnow is lost in the fog and presumably eaten by the monster . After Penn and the assistant director ( AD ) , Robert O'Meara , sneak away in the liferaft , Herzog decides to put on the ship 's sole wetsuit and swim to shore for help . Before he can do so , however , Nessie returns to finally sink the ship . While holding a camera in a water-resistant housing , Herzog captures underwater images of a large creature passing him in the murky , dark water . The next day , Penn is found by vacationers on holiday and leads them back to recover all but O'Meara and Karnow , who are presumed dead .

However , this never becomes completely obvious , and the film ends without making it clear exactly who is duping whom . # Production # The entire movie is actually a mockumentary **32;4423;TOOLONG invented by Penn . The ruse is revealed in Easter eggs hidden on the DVD . Penn wrote what he calls a scriptment ( part script , part treatment ) that outlined the specific structure of the film and including key dialogue that was needed in order to advance the plot , but left most of the dialogue and interaction up to the participants to work out as improvisation . As shown on the DVD , the hoax was on even before photography started as several media outlets announced the upcoming production as an actual film . Adding to the verisimilitude is the fact that everyone who appears on screen is a real person and most are in fact who they say they are . For example , DP Gabriel Beristain and soundman Russell Williams II are well-known , distinguished professionals who did work on the productions they respectively name on screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' scored a rating of 62% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 47 reviews . It also received a score of 62 on Metacritic based on 20 critics , indicating generally favorable reviews . Critic Roger Ebert enjoyed the film , giving it 3 stars out of 4 , saying : Watching the movie is an entertaining exercise in forensic viewing , and the insidious thing is , even if it is a con , who is the conner and who is the connee ? Kenneth Turan of the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' called it : an amusing mock documentary that spends considerable energy artfully trying to make you believe it 's real as real can be . # References #
