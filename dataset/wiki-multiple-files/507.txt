@@1933514 Ken Hill ( 28 January 1937 23 January 1995 ) was a critically acclaimed English playwright , and theatre director . He was a protg of Joan Littlewood at Theatre Workshop . He was happiest directing chaotic musicals on the tiny stage of the old Theatre Royal Stratford East , Theatre Workshop 's home in Stratford , London , for many years but he also had hits in the West End and abroad , among them ' ' The Invisible Man ' ' and the original stage version of ' ' The Phantom of the Opera ' ' , which inspired Andrew Lloyd Webber to create his musical blockbuster of the same title . His stock-in-trade was musical adventure stories . Like Joan Littlewood , his aim was to make things look fresh and improvised , to which end he might spend hours working on one tiny scene with his cast . He set his lyrics to out-of-copyright popular tunes , so that the audience felt familiar with his songs without ever quite being able to place them , and , more importantly , so that music could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being famously small . He had an encyclopaedic musical knowledge . For example , in his final show , ' ' Zorro The Musical ! ' ' , his lyrics were accompanied by melodies from 19th-century Spanish operetta . # Biography # Ken Hill was born in Birmingham , England on 28 January 1937 and was educated at King Edward 's School , after which he joined an amateur theatrical company , Crescent Theatre , sweeping the floor , making props , writing and directing . His first play , ' ' Night Season ' ' , was put on at the Alexandra Theatre , Birmingham , in 1963 . For a time he worked as an investigative journalist for ATV and it was there that he caused a minor uproar with his report on corruption in Birmingham 's local government . In 1970 , Joan Littlewood 's Theatre Workshop returned to its old home , the dilapidated Theatre Royal Stratford East . A satire on local authorities was discussed as a good subject for a new production , and Hill 's name was put forward as a possible writer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up Your End ' ' ( 1970 ) was condemned by some of the press for its juvenile humour but Joan Littlewood liked it and Hill stayed on . He was roped in as an actor in numerous productions but writing , not acting , remained his first love . He was made associate director and resident writer at Theatre Workshop from 1970 to 1974 and from 1974 to 1976 he took over as artistic director , Joan Littlewood by this time having left for projects in Tunisia . Hill 's productions there included ' ' Is Your Doctor Really Necessary ? ' ' ( 1973 ) , a collaboration with hit songwriter Tony Macaulay , ' ' The Count of Monte Cristo ' ' ( 1974 ) , ' ' Gentlemen Prefer Anything ' ' ( 1974 ) and ' ' Dracula ' ' ( 1974 ) . He then became artistic director of the Musical Theatre Company , directing for the West End : ' ' Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat ' ' at the Westminster Theatre ( for Andrew Lloyd Webber ) , ' ' The Mikado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' . Other West End credits include playdoctoring productions of ' ' Drake 's Dream ' ' and ' ' Wren ' ' . Shortly after , he was commissioned by the National Theatre for a version of ' ' The Hunchback Of Notre Dame ' ' . He then wrote and directed for television : ' ' All the Fun of the Fair ' ' in the course of his life , Ken wrote over 100 scripts for various television programmes . His other commissions for various theatres include : ' ' The Curse of the Werewolf ' ' , ' ' The Mummy 's Tomb ' ' , ' ' Mafeking ' ' , ' ' The Three Musketeers ' ' , ' ' Bel Ami ' ' , ' ' The Living Dead ' ' , and a new translation of ' ' La Vie Parisienne ' ' . Ken was also commissioned for productions of ' ' Sweeney Todd ' ' , ' ' Little Shop Of Horrors ' ' , and a ' ' Narnia ' ' Trilogy . He also adapted and directed two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham Repertory Theatre . He cut a conspicuous front-of-house figure , joking with customers at the bar , and patrolling the stage with little solo dances until the audience was settled . In rehearsal he would leap about the stage to demonstrate ideas to his actors , a sight made even more alarming by his height and shock of red hair . He could be stinting with praise for his actors and had little small talk ; but he always got the best out of his cast.He also got the best out of his backstage crew with his direct approach to achieving his desired effect on stage , particularly his approach to set design encapsulated in often heard phrase jig it out of a bit of ply when facing budgetary pressures . He left Theatre Workshop in 1976 and worked for some years as the Director of Productions at the Newcastle Playhouse . That same year , he first staged his version of ' ' The Phantom of the Opera ' ' at the Duke 's Playhouse in Lancaster ( and also on Morecambe Pier ) . In 1983 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an elaborate stage musical for the Playhouse with songs by Eric Boswell . In 1984 , an updated version of ' ' The Phantom of the Opera ' ' was revived and produced in a joint-production with the Newcastle Playhouse and the Theatre Royal Stratford East . Andrew Lloyd Webber saw and liked it , and for a while there was talk about his bringing it into the West End . Nothing came of this , however , and Lloyd Webber 's own version duly opened in the West End in 1986 . Hill 's ' ' Phantom ' ' went abroad to St. Louis in the United States in 1987 and also had another major production in San Francisco in 1988 . The musical then embarked on a two-year long national tour of the US from 19891991 . The show also transferred to the West End in 1991 but , despite excellent notices , did badly at the box office and was forced to close earlier than expected . Since then , ' ' The Phantom of the Opera ' ' has arguably become one of his most famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production was in Tokyo , Japan in November 2004 . ' ' The Invisible Man ' ' , with illusions by the magician , Paul Kieve , fared much better in the West End , transferring from Stratford East to the Vaudeville Theatre in 1993 . This show was a particular favourite of Hill 's , combining his love of stage trickery and childish optical jokes in scenes in which , for instance , the unbandaged ' invisible ' head of the Invisible Man smokes a cigar . Hill made everyone working in the theatre , from the cleaning staff upwards , sign a document forbidding them to reveal how this was done to the press . Despite having cancer intermittently for 12 years , Hill still continued to deluge Stratford East with ideas for new productions right up until his death from his cancer on 23 January 1995 aged 57 , and only five days before his 58th birthday . He died just two weeks before the opening of what was his final production , ' ' Zorro The Musical ! ' ' , which he directed . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rave reviews and immense box office success . Hill was survived by his wife , the actress Toni Palmer ( who appeared in many of his shows ) , and two sons from a previous marriage . # Other information # The Ken Hill Memorial Trust was set up after Hill died in 1995 , to aid the Theatre Royal in supporting new talent in musical theatre . It now offers a biennial Musical Theatre Award annually to help nurture new talent in theatrical writers . The award in 1997 was a total of 5,000 for the winner 1000 in cash , with the balance going towards the production costs of a week 's showcase at the Theatre Royal , where many of Ken Hill 's works were premiered . In addition , royalties were paid to the writer for the showcase . The trustees also offered small cash prizes to five runners up . There is now news as to whether this trust or award still exists today or not . There are also Ken Hill awards for new talented playwrights and for the Best New Musical . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , ' ' The Curse of the Werewolf ' ' , ' ' The Mummy 's Tomb ' ' and his version of ' ' The Phantom of the Opera ' ' , are available to purchase from Samuel French Ltd. in London .
