@@3993514 Moira ( ) is a village and civil parish in County Down , Northern Ireland . It is in the northwest of the county , near the borders with counties Antrim and Armagh . The M1 motorway and BelfastDublin railway line are nearby . The settlement has existed since time immemorial . In a 2008 estimate the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency approximated the population of Moira to be 4,221. # History # # Toponymy # The etymology of Moira is somewhat uncertain . It seems to be an anglicisation of the Irish ' ' Maigh Rath ' ' , which may mean either ' plain of the wheels ' or ' plain of the ringforts ' . Another Irish form of the name is ' ' Mag Rath ' ' . The change most probably occurred during or before the Plantation of Ulster . Regardless Moira has now evolved to become both the official name and the one in everyday use . # Prehistory to Early Modern Period # Moira has been a settlement for at least 1,500 years . For the period it consisted most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Evidence of three such forts still remain . The best known of these is the so-called Rough Fort , situated on the Old Kilmore Road . However the remains of Pretty Mary 's Fort exist behind the Waringfield residential area . Finally evidence of a third ringfort can be found near Claremont . The existence of these primitive defences , coupled with the good-view afforded from the top of Moira hill , made the settlement strategically valuable . Proximity to Lough Neagh enhanced this value . Accordingly during the repeated power struggles of the first millennium the area was often fought over , and eventually witnessed the largest battle in the history of Ireland when three tribal kings contested the area to determine supremacy in Ulster and beyond . This was the Battle of Moira . Its impact on Moira is still felt ; two townlands still bear battle names , Aughnafosker ( meaning field of slaughter ) and Carnalbanagh ( meaning the Scotsman 's grave ) . After the battle a Bishop by the name of Ronan Finn ( who was later canonized ) was alleged to have created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains shrouded in mystery . It is known that the town and its hinterland were under the control of the O'Lavery Clan for a considerable period . They were Catholic families who held sway in large parts of Armagh . Indeed prior to the Nine Years War Ulster was the most gaelic part of Ireland . There were few towns , few roads and much of the country was thickly wooded . However the subjugation of Ulster by the victorious armies of Elizabeth I greatly reduced the clout of gaelic hierarchs , the O'Laverys included . But it was their participation in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 doomed their dominance . The English authorities crushed the rebellion and confiscated vast amounts of native Irish property , in Moira as in the rest of Ireland . As a direct result of this the Protestant plantations of Ulster ( which began in 1606 ) was accelerated . # #Arrival of the Rawdon family# # In 1631 Major George Rawdon , a wealthy man from the village of Rawdon in Yorkshire , settled in Moira . During the Irish Rebellion of 1641 he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neill and re-secure Moira and its environs for the Crown . In 1651 an officer by the name of Major de Burgh purchased a small estate and built a brick house in Moira . This house , the forerunner of Moira Castle , was subsequently purchased by Rawdon . Following his actions in putting down rebellion Rawdon subsequently purchased vast amounts of land in the area ( most probably financed by confiscations from the dead or subjugated Catholic rebels ) , and was said to have developed it greatly . In 1665 he was created a baronet by Charles II . At some point in his life he became a Member of Parliament . Somewhat unfortunately he was nicknamed the ' Great Highwayman ' for his development of roads infrastructure in and around Moira . Sir George Rawdon was succeeded in his title by his son Sir Arthur Rawdon . # #Later Rawdon Baronets# # Sir Arthur ( who would also become an Irish MP ) became a General in the armies of King William III during the Jacobite War in Ireland . He was quickly besieged in Derry , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant Ascendancy of which he was a part yet again restored , Sir Arthur ( who had presumably profited greatly from the war ) returned to Moira . Having inherited the brick mahor house his father had purchased he decided to expand it greatly , and it became one of the largest residences in the whole island , to be called Moira Castle . The castle , which in fact was a mansion , was also accompanied by vast gardens . These gardens became world famous . In 1690 Sir Arthur utilised his friendship with fellow Downshire-born botanist Sir Hans Sloane , and acquired from him the seeds of 400 exotic plants , and instructions in how to grow them . To fit his ends Sir Arthur also constructed in Moira the first hothouse in Europe . The subsequent baronets maintained the gardens ( though the hothouse did not survive ) for generations . In 1723 Sir John Rawdon , 3rd Baronet helped fund the construction of the Anglican Moira Parish Church , dedicated to St. John . # #The Lords Rawdon# # In 1750 Sir John Rawdon , 4th Baronet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baron Rawdon of Moira . He subsequently flirted with Methodism , and invited John Wesley to speak at Moira Church . This caused a major religious rift in the town . And though Wesley did speak , he did so from the grounds of Moira Castle , not the church for which the Rawdons had largely paid . He was also granted a higher title in 1762 by King George III , when he was made Earl of Moira . In addition to flirting with Methodism Lord Rawdon also flirted with Irish self-government ( albeit under the Ascendancy ) , opposing the efforts of William Pitt to forge closer links with Great Britain in the first decade of his Ministry . His death in 1793 was significant in Moira history , in that it marked the largest funeral in the history of Ireland , a testament to his extensive political connections . Over four hundred carriages were in procession . This Lord Rawdon is buried in the family crypt in the church . Upon his death his son Francis Rawdon-Hastings became the Earl of Moira . A respected general and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the family was nevertheless negative for the town of Moira , which had risen greatly in prestige as a result of his predecessors . He neglected the gardens in the Moira estate , which subsequently declined into decay . He also spent the vast majority of his time in England . # Moira 1800-Present # The 2nd Earl was raised to a yet-higher rank of the peerage in 1816 , when he was created Marquess of Hastings , subordinating the Moira title . Lord Hastings would be the last member of the Rawdon family to reside in Moira Castle ( which he had always used as a secondary residence in any case ) . In 1805 he sold it to Sir Robert Bateson , 1st Baronet , who also did not use it as a primary residence . The status of Moira thus declined considerably . The Rawdons ' legacy would linger , however , with several streets and housing developments bearing their name centuries later . Fortunately for the denizens of Moira the Acts of Union had reduced the power of the Ascendency , and Moira was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Reform Act had reduced the ability of landowners in general and lords in particular to control Moira . Moira itself continued to develop during this period . A canal was built to the north ( which became the boundary between Counties Antrim and Down ) , and a Market Hall completed at the expense of the Bateson family in about 1810 . It was considered to have market the completion of the village . In 1841 Moira railway station was completed , and is now the oldest such structure on the island of Ireland . Moira Castle itself was vacated by the Batesons , and was demolished during the Victorian Era . A few gate stumps remain , as does some stepping for the famous gardens , and the dug-out cellar . During the Second World War the grounds of Moira Demesne ( as the Castle had become known ) were used by the army as a medical centre . # 1998 Bombing # Moira remained relatively uneventful for most of the 20th century , but did not escape The Troubles . On 20 February 1998 dissident republicans planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the police station , injuring 11 people . The bomb was intended to kill police officers due to do a shift change . The blast was so loud that it could be heard fully twenty miles ( 32 km ) away in Belfast . The bomb caused extensive damage , resulting in the police station and several nearby buildings having to be rebuilt . The bombing also threatened to derail the peace process at the time . # Government and Politics # Moira is at the very edge of the boundaries of the City of Lisburn , and is therefore subject to the local government authority of Lisburn City Council . Both the overall council and the electoral area ( Killultagh ) for Moira are dominated by unionist parties . During the 2011 council elections the members elected for Killultagh were , in order of preference , as follows : *Thomas Beckett - Democratic Unionist Party *Jim Tinsley - Democratic Unionist Party *Pat Catney - Social Democratic and Labour Party *Jim Dillon - Ulster Unionist Party *John Palmer - Democratic Unionist Party At a national level Moira is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donaldson .
