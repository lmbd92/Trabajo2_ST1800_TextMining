' ' The Prime Network was a group of regional sports networks owned by Liberty Media that served several regionalized areas that was in operation between 1988 and late-1996 . While Liberty owned many of these stations , some were affiliates and owned by other companies . As a result , affiliate stations had a choice of what the Prime Network programming they would air and when . # History # The original Prime Ticket Network ( based on Los Angeles ) launched in 1985 as a joint-venture between Lakers and Kings owner Jerry Buss and Bill Daniels . Within a few years Daniels bought out most of Buss 's share and become majority owner . In late 1988 Daniels partnered with Tele-Communications Inc. and Prime Sports Rocky Mountain was launched .

On November 1 , 1996 , the Prime Network names were dropped for the FSN name nationwide . In 2007 , Liberty bought back FSN Pittsburgh , FSN Rocky Mountain , and FSN Northwest from News Corporation .

The network also was the first to televise NASCAR Sprint ( then Winston ) Cup qualifying on a regular basis , mainly for races televised by TBS . Prime also televised a number of NASCAR Busch Series races , including the Goody 's 300 at Daytona , in the early 1990s .

In other words , they shared time with other cable networks on some cable systems . For example , Home Sports Entertainment ( now FSN Southwest ) shared time with QVC network on some cable outlets , mainly in Texas . Ironically , QVC is now owned by Liberty Media , who owned Prime . However , during the Prime/QVC timeshare , QVC was owned by Comcast . Usually , QVC would air from about 3 a.m. -1 p.m. on a given day , and then Prime would take over with its feed and feature a brief sign-on and display its bright red HSE symbol in a large font . They would then give a program listing of the day 's shows , which was usually superimposed over a decorative sports-related background , such as a basketball court . Some cable systems would scramble HSE when its feed took over because they treated it as a premium channel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s. # Owned and Operated # *KBL ( now Root Sports Pittsburgh ) *La Cadena Deportiva ( Spanish Language version of Prime Ticket , now Fox Deportes ) *Premier Sports ( now Fox Sports Australia ) *Prime Deportiva ( now Fox Sports Latin America ) *Prime Sports Arizona ( now Fox Sports Arizona ) *Prime Sports Asia ( now STAR Sports ) *Prime Sports Midwest ( now Fox Sports Midwest ) *Prime Sports Northwest ( formerly Northwest Cable Sports , now Root Sports Northwest ) *Prime Sports Rocky Mountain ( now Root Sports Rocky Mountain ) *Prime Sports Intermountain West ( now Root Sports Utah ) *Prime Sports Southwest ( formerly Home Sports Entertainment ( HSE ) , now Fox Sports Southwest ) *Prime Sports Upper Midwest *Prime Ticket ( now an FSN affiliate , sister station to Fox Sports West ) *SportSouth ( now Fox Sports South ) *Sunshine Network ( now Sun Sports ) # Affiliates # *Empire Sports Network ( now defunct , replaced by Time Warner Cable SportsChannel ) *Home Team Sports ( now Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic ) *Midwest Sports Channel ( now Fox Sports North ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay Area ) *PASS Sports ( now defunct , replaced by Fox Sports Detroit )
