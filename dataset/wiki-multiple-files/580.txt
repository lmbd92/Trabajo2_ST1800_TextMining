@@2302514 Enterprise software , also known as enterprise software application ( ESA ) , is purposed-designed computer software used to satisfy the needs of an organization rather than individual users . Such organizations can vary from businesses , schools , interest-based user groups and clubs , retailers , or governments . Enterprise software is an integral part of a ( computer based ) Information System , and as such includes web site software production . Services provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented tools such as online shopping and online payment processing , interactive product catalogue , automated billing systems , security , enterprise content management , IT service management , customer relationship management , enterprise resource planning , business intelligence , project management , collaboration , human resource management , manufacturing , enterprise application integration , and enterprise forms automation . As enterprises have similar departments and systems in common , enterprise software is often available as a suite of customizable programs . Generally , the complexity of these tools requires specialist capabilities and specific knowledge . # Definitions # Enterprise software describes a collection of computer programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire organization works , and development tools for building applications unique to the organization . The software is intended to solve an enterprise-wide problem , rather than a departmental problem . Enterprise level software aims to improve the enterprise 's productivity and efficiency by providing business logic support functionality . According to Martin Fowler , Enterprise applications are about the display , manipulation , and storage of large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation of business processes with that data . Although there is no single , widely accepted list of enterprise software characteristics , they generally include performance , scalability , and robustness . Furthermore , enterprise software typically has interfaces to other enterprise software ( for example LDAP to directory services ) and is centrally managed ( a single admin page , for example ) . Enterprise application software performs business functions such as order processing , procurement , production scheduling , customer information management , energy management , and accounting . It is typically hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to a large number of users , typically over a computer network . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed on a user 's personal computer and serves only one user at a time . # Types # Enterprise software can be categorized by business function . Each type of enterprise application can be considered a system due to the integration with a firm 's business processes . Categories of enterprise software may overlap due to this systemic interpretation . For example , IBM 's Business Intelligence platform ( Cognos ) , integrates with a predictive analytics platform ( SPSS ) and can obtain records from its database packages ( Infosphere , DB2 ) . Blurred lines between package functions make delimitation difficult , and in many ways larger software companies define these somewhat arbitrary categories . Nevertheless , certain industry standard product categories have emerged , and these are shown below : * Accounting software * Business intelligence * Business process management * Content management system ( CMS ) * Customer relationship management ( CRM ) * Database ** Master data management ( MDM ) * Enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) * Enterprise asset management ( EAM ) # Developers # Major organizations in the enterprise software field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Software , HP Software Division , Redwood Software , IFS AB , QAD Inc , UC4 Software , JBoss/WildFly ( Red Hat ) , Microsoft , Adobe Systems , Oracle Corporation and CA Technologies but there are thousands of competing vendors globally . # Enterprise Social Software # Businesses also use Enterprise Social Software sometimes known as Enterprise 2.0 . Yammer Inc. which was sold to Microsoft is an example of such software .
