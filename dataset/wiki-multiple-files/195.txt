Other sources establish the origin of marzipan in China , from where the recipe moved on to the Middle East and then to Europe through Al-Andalus. # Northeast Mediterranean line # Although it is believed to have originated in Persia ( present-day Iran ) and to have been introduced to Europe through the Turks ( ' ' badem ezmesi ' ' in Turkish , and most notably produced in Edirne ) , there is some dispute between Hungary and Italy over its origin . Marzipan became a specialty of the Baltic Sea region of Germany . In particular , the city of Lbeck has a proud tradition of marzipan manufacture ( Lbecker Marzipan ( ' ' PGI ' ' ) . The city 's manufacturers like Niederegger still guarantee their marzipan to contain two thirds almonds by weight , which results in a product of highest quality .

In Toledo ( 850-900 , though more probably 1150 during the reign of Alfonso VII ) this specialty was known as ' ' Postre Regio ' ' ( instead of ' ' Mazapn ' ' ) and there are also mentions in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights of an almond paste eaten during Ramadan and as an aphrodisiac . Mazapn is Toledo 's most famous dessert , often created for Christmas , and has PGI status . Almonds have to be at least 50% of the total weight , following the directives of ' ' Mazapn de Toledo ' ' regulator counseil . Another idea to support this line is the important tradition of another Spanish almond-based Christmas confectionery , the turron .

Many confectionery products sold as marzipan are made from less expensive materials , such as soy paste and almond essence . German marzipan is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste , and French marzipan ( called ' massepain ' ) is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup . Some marzipan is flavored with rosewater . Spanish marzipan is made without bitter almonds . # Etymology # The German name has largely ousted the original English name ' ' marchpane ' ' with the same apparent derivation : March bread . ( The word ' ' marchpane ' ' occurs in Shakespeare 's ' ' Romeo and Juliet ' ' , Act 1 , Scene 5 , Line 9 . ) ' ' Marzapane ' ' is documented earlier in Italian than in any other language , and the sense bread for ' ' pan ' ' is Romance .

Though , it could also be derived from martis pan , bread of March . Among the other possible etymologies set forth in the Oxford English Dictionary , one theory proposes that the word marzipan may be a corruption of Martaban , a Burmese city famous for its jars . The Real Academia Espaola suggests the idea of the Spanish word mazapn to be derived from the Hispanic Arabic pim , which is derived from the Greek .

From about the fifteenth century , when the coins were no longer in circulation , the boxes became decorative containers for storing and serving luxury sweetmeats . One such luxury that crept into the box in the sixteenth century is the now-famous almond-flavored marzipan , named ( at least proximately ) after the box in which it was stored . However , if marzipan has its origin in Persia , it is not unlikely that the name may come from Marzban ( in Persian : , derived from the words Marz meaning border or boundary and the suffix -bn meaning guardian ) , a class of margraves or military commanders in charge of border provinces of the Sassanid Empire of Persia ( Iran ) between 3rd and 7th centuries CE . It is also a possibility that the origin of this dessert and the origin of the term come from different geographical places . # Production # To produce marzipan , raw almonds are cleaned by sieving , air elutriation , and other electronic or mechanical devices , then immersed in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes .
