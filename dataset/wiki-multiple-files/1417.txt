This has resulted in excellent but high-priced treatment which , however , fails to delivers services at a reasonable price to the lower social classes . With only a few exceptions , neither government-sponsored health care programs such as Medicare nor Medicaid cover routine dental treatment . As a result large sections of the population do without . The worst conditions are in Kentucky and West Virginia . Rates for dental services have been rising rapidly , out pacing the rate of inflation . After falling for many years , the percentage of both adults and children with unfilled cavities began to rise in 2000 as did the percentage of adults with no teeth . Increasingly , people with adequate income to pay the fees are forgoing treatment . # Dental therapists # Outside the United States , more than 50 countries allow technicians called dental therapists to drill and fill cavities , usually in children .

Licensure is organized on three levels in most areas . Many dentists must pass National Boards , Regional Boards , and then take a jurisprudence exam accepted by their state to fulfill their requirements to get a state license . Not all states require or even accept regional boards .
