@@2315514 Preston Hollow is a neighborhood in north Dallas , Texas , USA . It is bordered on the south by the city of University Park , Texas , an enclave within Dallas . # History # In 1924 Ira De-Loache bought a 56acre ha farm . Preston Hollow 's first lots were carved out of the former farm parcels . De-Loache and Al Joyce developed Preston Hollow , with development largely occurring in the 1930s . At first Preston Road was the area 's only connection to Downtown Dallas . Terry Box of ' ' The Dallas Morning News ' ' said that the Northwest Highway was nothing more than muddy right of way . The area that would later become Preston Center was a Dairy Farm in the early to mid-20th Century . Preston Hollow eventually extended from east of Preston Road , slightly north of Walnut Hill Lane , west of Midway Road and southwest of Northwest Highway . The developers intended Preston Hollow to be what Box said was more than a flatland suburb on the fringes of a new and growing Dallas . Doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Preston Hollow . Many built country-style estates that housed horses and stables . A private school which later became St. Mark 's School of Texas opened in the area . In the early 1930s during the Depression , Edward James Solon , the treasurer of a company called Interstate and the partner who came with Karl Hoblitzelle from Chicago to Dallas , purchased the first Preston Hollow corner property at Douglas and Averill Way . DeLoache built a Dillbeck designed house on the property . This Tudor styled home was considered the first of the many large homes built in what is now termed the Old Preston Hollow area -- an earlier large house in the area , by the pond near Avrill , was considered as part of the farm . In the 1930s , moving beyond the Northwest Highway was considered going into the sticks and risky in terms of attracting affluent homeowners . Later many people said that E.J. Solon started the North Dalllas migration .

In 1956 , the neighborhood association 's covenant stated that only white residents were allowed to live in Preston Hollow .
