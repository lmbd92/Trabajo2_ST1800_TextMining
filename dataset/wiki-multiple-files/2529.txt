@@21631514 A late protein is a viral protein that is formed after replication of the virus . One example is VP4 from simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) . In Human papillomavirus , two late proteins are involved in capsid formation : a major ( L1 ) and a minor ( L2 ) protein , in the approximate proportion 95:5% . L1 forms a pentameric assembly unit of the viral shell in a manner that closely resembles VP1 from polyomaviruses . Intermolecular disulphide bonding holds the L1 capsid proteins together . L1 capsid proteins can bind via its nuclear localisation signal ( NLS ) to karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) and inhibit the Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle . Surface loops on L1 pentamers contain sites of sequence variation between HPV types . L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection : in the initial phase after virion disassembly , and in the productive phase when it assembles into replicated virions along with L1 major capsid proteins . L2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation signals ( NLSs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other at the C-terminal ( cNLS ) . L2 uses its NLSs to interact with a network of karyopherins in order to enter the nucleus via several import pathways . L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact with karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) . L2 capsid proteins can also interact with viral dsDNA , facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after viral uncoating.
