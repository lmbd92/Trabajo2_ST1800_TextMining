@@841514 The name Ambazonia or Ambazania refers to two separate entities . One pertains to an advocacy group struggling for the total restoration of the statehood of the former British League of Nations Mandate of Southern Cameroons . It is also used to refer to the Southern Cameroons by organisations that struggle for the dissolution of the 1961 union of the Southern Cameroons with Cameroun. # Etymology # The term Ambazonia is derived from the word ' ' Amboises ' ' , the bay at the mouth of the Wouri ( now Douala ) river . # History # The ' ' Republic of Ambazonia ' ' was declared by the Southern Cameroons National Council ( SCNC ) as an independent state on 31 December 1999 .

In the view of some , particularly in the former British Cameroon , this meant a dissolution of the 1961 personal union . It was in this light that beginning in 1984 , Ambazonia , was declared to represent a timely intervention of the people of Southern Cameroons to return the statehood of the former British Southern Cameroons territory . Ambazonia saw this not as the ' ' fait accompli ' ' of a one Cameroon state but as an opportunity to engage both states into a ' constitutional review ' of their post-1984 relations . Ambazonia believed that by operation of the law , there should be an equal participation by the two states that made up the now extinct federation , in a new vision for their countries ' ( Republic of Cameroon and the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dubbed the new Social Order , the Ambazonia 's proposal of CACIN ( the Cameroon-Ambazonia Confederacy of Independent Nations ) was summarily rejected by the Republic of Cameroon . Instead , the leader of ARC ( Ambazonia Restoration Council ) , Fon Gorji-Dinka , was arrested and tried for treason for claiming the continuing existence of the sovereignty of the ' Southern Cameroons ' in the Republic of Ambazonia . In 1992 , Fon Gorji-Dinka , on behalf of the state of Republic of Ambazonia filed a lawsuit against the Republic of Cameroon and President Paul Biya on the main charge of the Republic of Cameroon 's illegal and forcible occupation since the 1984 dissolution of the United Republic of Cameroon and the declaration of the Republic of Ambazonia . This suit was registered with the Bamenda High Court in the Northwest region of Cameroon as case number HCB28/92. # ( b ) President Paul Biya is also guilty of treason for furthering and completing the treason of Ahidjo by bringing about the secession of the first defendant ( East Cameroon ) from the United Republic of Cameroon on February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had not been used since January 10 , 1961.

II , No. 04 , February 10 , 1993 . In a 2005 judgment of the United Nations Human Rights ICCPR ( International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ) Tribunal Communication 1134/2002 , the United Nations Human Rights Tribunal ruled in favor of compensation for Fon Gorji-Dinka for human rights abuses to his person and for assurances of the enjoyment of his civil and political rights . # Geography # Ambazonia has a land size of 43,000 square kilometres and a population of approximately 6 million people according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been subject to political manipulation ; the number is likely closer to 8 million ) . It is thus slightly larger than the Netherlands , ranked the 131st largest country and has about as many inhabitants as Paraguay , the world 's 93rd largest country in terms of population .
