@@7410514 Meru North District was one of the unconstitutionally created districts of Kenya , located in that country 's Eastern Province . In 1992 , it was split from the large Meru District , along with Meru Central District , Meru South District ( Nithi ) , and Tharaka District . Since the Supreme Court 's decision in September 2009 , Meru North is again part of Meru County . The area of Meru North District is the home of the Ameru ( Meru ) tribe , which is sometimes described as being related to other tribes living around the Mount Kenya region : the Kikuyu and the Embu people . The Ameru are generally called Bantu people who have been native to the Mt . Kenya area for many , many years -- well before colonization of Kenya by Great Britain in the 19th Century . The people are now predominantly Christian -- Methodist , Presbyterian , Roman Catholic , and other denominations , reflecting the work of missionaries -- with also minorities of Indian descent , who are mainly Hindus , and African/Arab descent , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British in ancestry . Meru is well known for its production of khat , known locally as ' ' miraa ' ' , and its supply to the rest of the country 's major towns . Because of the rich soils in the area , this plant thrives and most of the residents benefit from its sale . Trading in this commodity is a boon to other vendors , for example it stimulates the sale of banana leaves to ' ' miraa ' ' traders to protect the khat harvest from drying . The district headquarters was in the town of Maua . There were four constituencies in the district : *Igembe South Constituency *Igembe North Constituency *Tigania East Constituency *Tigania West Constituency
