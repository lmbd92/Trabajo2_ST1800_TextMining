@@7165514 Communications servers are open , standards-based computing systems that operate as a carrier-grade common platform for a wide range of communications applications and allow equipment providers to add value at many levels of the system architecture . Based on industry-managed standards such as AdvancedTCA , MicroTCA <sup> TM </sup> , Carrier Grade Linux and Service Availability <sup> TM </sup> Forum specifications , communications servers are the foundational platform upon which equipment providers build network infrastructure elements for deployments such as IP Multimedia Subsystem ( IMS ) , IPTV and wireless broadband ( e.g. WiMAX ) . Support for communications servers as a category of server is developing rapidly throughout the communications industry . Standards bodies , industry associations , vendor alliance programs , hardware and software manufacturers , communications server vendors and users are all part of an increasingly robust communications server ecosystem . Regardless of their specific , differentiated features , communications servers have the following attributes : open , flexible , carrier-grade , and communications-focused. # Attributes # # Open # *Based on industry-managed open standards *Broad , multi-vendor ecosystem *Industry certified interoperability *Availability of tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfaces *Multiple competitive options for standards-based modules # Flexible # *Designed to easily incorporate application-specific added value at all levels of the solution *Can be rapidly repurposed as needs change to protect customer investment *Multi-level , scalable , bladed architecture *Meets needs of multiple industries beyond telecommunications , such as medical imaging , defense and aerospace # Carrier grade # *Designed for **Longevity of supply **Extended lifecycle ( 10 years ) support **High availability ( 5NINES ) *Non-disruptively upgradeable and updateable *Hard real time capability to ensure quality of service for critical traffic *Meets network building regulations # Industry-managed standards # Several industry-managed standards are critical to the success of communications servers , including : # AdvancedTCA # The Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture ( ATCA ) is a series of PCI Industrial Computers Manufacturers Group ( PICMG ) specifications , targeted to meet the requirements for carrier grade communications equipment . This series of specifications incorporates the latest trends in high speed interconnect technologies , next generation processors and improved reliability , manageability and serviceability. # AdvancedMC # The PICMG Advanced Mezzanine Card specification defines the base-level requirements for a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to , AdvancedTCA Carriers . AdvancedMC enhances AdvancedTCAs flexibility by extending its high-bandwidth , multi-protocol interface to individual hot-swappable modules . # MicroTCA # This PICMG specification provides a framework for combining AdvancedMC modules directly , without the need for an AdvancedTCA or custom carrier . MicroTCA is aimed at smaller equipment such as wireless base stations , Wi-Fi and WiMAX radios , and VoIP access gateways where small physical size low entry cost , and scalability are key requirements . # Carrier Grade Linux # An enhanced version of Linux for use in a highly available , secure , scalable , and maintainable carrier grade system . The specification is managed by the CGL Working Group of the Open Source Development Labs . # HPI and AIS # These Service Availability Forum ( SA Forum ) specifications define standard interfaces for telecom platform management and high-availability software . The Hardware Platform Interface ( HPI ) specification defines the interface between high availability middleware and the underlying hardware and operating system . At a higher layer than HPI , the Application Interface Specification ( AIS ) defines the application programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIS allows an application to run on multiple computing modules , and applications that support AIS can migrate more easily between computing platforms from different manufacturers that support the standard . In addition to the standards development organizations mentioned above , four industry associations / vendor alliance programs are playing key roles in the development of the communications server ecosystem. # Industry associations # # SCOPE Alliance # SCOPE Alliance is an industry alliance committed to accelerating the deployment of carrier grade base platforms for service provider applications . Its mission is to help , enable and promote the availability of open carrier grade base platforms based on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf hardware / software and Free Open Source Software building blocks , and to promote interoperability to better serve Service Providers and consumers . # # The Communications Platforms Trade Association ( CP-TA ) is an association of communications platforms and building block providers dedicated to accelerating the adoption of SIG-governed , open specification-based communications platforms through interoperability certification . With industry collaboration , the CP-TA plans to drive a mainstream market for open industry standards-based communications platforms by certifying interoperable products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community of communications and embedded developers and solutions providers committed to the development of modular , standards-based solutions on Intel technologies . # # The is an ecosystem of technology , service and solution providers aligned to provide standards-based solution elements validated with Motorolas communications servers . Alliance participants receive access to Motorola embedded communications computing product roadmaps , development systems , and participate in marketing activities with Motorola . # # The is an ecosystem of technology , service and solution providers aligned to provide Open Source , Open Standards-based communication software . Community members contribute to the Mobicents product roadmaps , research , development , and marketing activities .
