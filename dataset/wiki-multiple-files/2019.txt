The lines of the train were designed by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro . Group E.491 was designed to be used on freight trains ( max speed 140km/h abbr=on ) while E.492 was designed for fast passenger trains ( max speed 160km/h abbr=on ) . They were intended to be used on the rail lines of Sardinia , at the time subject of future electrification . The project was later abandoned , but a lot of units had already been ordered and built , and since the catenary on the mainland is mostly 3 kV DC ( except for high speed lines ) , and the locomotive was only able to run on 25 kV AC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to sell them to foreign railways ( France and Bulgaria ) , but never succeeded . In 2008 , the whole batch of 25 locomotives were sold to Fruilexport , a company established in Ni ( Serbia ) . It seems thenceforth likely that they will be used on the Serbian 25 kV network .
