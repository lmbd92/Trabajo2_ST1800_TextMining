Her first album of all-original material since 2006 's ' ' The Greatest ' ' , it was released on September 3 , 2012 , in the United Kingdom and in the United States on September 4 , 2012 , via Matador Records . The album was issued in a variety of formats , including a limited edition deluxe LP containing a 7 vinyl of bonus tracks . The album 's lead single , Ruin , was released for free download at Matador Record 's store on June 20 , 2012 . A music video for album opener Cherokee , directed by Marshall , has recently been released , while an ambient remix of the song by Nicolas Jaar is available to download from Cat Power 's official website . The song was premired on NPR 's ' ' All Songs Considered ' ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as going in yet another direction . A lot more drive , a lot more electronics , drum machines , synthsit 's very bold . On April 10 , 2013 , Cat Power performed the previously unreleased track Bully on the premier episode of the forty-second series of Later .. with Jools Holland . Immediately following the broadcast , a new version of the album containing Bully as a bonus track was made available for download through iTunes. # Background and recording # Work on the album initially began soon after the release of ' ' The Greatest ' ' , with Marshall announcing the album 's title as far back as 2006 in an interview with ' ' The New York Times ' ' , where she also claimed that the entire album had already been written . Marshall decided to finance the recording of ' ' Sun ' ' herself , following financial difficulties arising from the cancellation of a lengthy tour in 2006 due to her hospitalisation . She was later declared bankrupt , claiming I had my house in foreclosure and I had n't paid taxes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing me and wondering what I was going to do with the advance for this album , I said , ' I 'm going to fucking pay for this shit myself . ' I knew that 'd be the only way I could control things . So I cashed out my retirement fund . Recording began sometime in 2007 , with Marshall building a studio in her Malibu home to record and produce new songs herself . However , much of the material recorded up to this point was later abandoned when Marshall decided it was too painful and personal to put out , stating I was writing all these really slow guitar songs , and my friend said , ' This is like depressing old Cat Power , ' which made me feel like I got shot . I did n't work for eight months after that . Progress on the album was delayed again with the recording and release of her second covers album ' ' Jukebox ' ' in 2008 , and later by her relationship with Giovanni Ribisi . Following the tour in support of ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studio in Silverlake , California , where she began work on newly written , electronic material , with Marshall claiming , I had no fucking idea what to do , but I knew I was not going to even look at a piano or touch a guitar . So I started out with a weird synthesizer . Eventually I had these skeletons of songs , but then I felt like a failure because I thought , ' This is not fucking good , I do n't know what I 'm doing . ' And I did n't know what I was doing . I had lyrics and a beat and notes , but I did n't have anything else . It sounded like a naked , shivering alien . This period of inactivity placed a strain on Marshall 's relationship with her label Matador who , concerned by the lack of progress , began pressuring Marshall to work with a producer . Marshallwho had n't worked with a producer since Ed Douglas recorded both ' ' Dear Sir ' ' and ' ' Myra Lee ' ' on the same day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a producer is like telling someone that they need a nose job . It activates something in you that makes you feel like a loser . It was around this time that Marshall regrouped at her home in Malibu with members of her backing band , the Dirty Delta Blues , to start preparation for a tour in the beginning of 2011 . Rehearsing many of the skeletal new compositions she had written , the band would go on to perform ten previously unreleased songs over the course of the tour ; including Cherokee , Ruin , Real Life and Human Being , as well as another six that would later be excluded from the album Bully , Brave Liar , Horizon , Let Me Go , Monster and Woman of My Word . Hoping to rerecord these songs with the band following completion of the tour , these sessions , according to Marshall , did n't work out the way she hoped , noting that Ruin is the only song on the album to feature contributions from the Dirty Delta Blues band . Production for the album continued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instrumentation from the aborted Dirty Blues Band sessions . After hearing a song from the Beastie Boys album ' ' Hot Sauce Committee Part Two ' ' on the radio , she contacted that album 's mixer , Cassius member Philippe Zdar , in the hope of a potential collaboration . Unable to pay Zdar for his mixing work until the album was finalised and presented to Matador for release , she transferred her work to Zdar 's recording studio in Francewhere he worked pro bonountil sessions for the album finally concluded in April 2012. # Critical reception # The album received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 78 , based on 44 reviews , which indicates generally favorable reviews . AllMusic editor Heather Phares , in a very positive review , commented that the album 's remarkably spare production aesthetic sounds all the more striking coming after ' ' The Greatest s lushness and said that Marshall 's willingness and ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds is n't such a far cry from the more sonically adventurous moments on ' ' Moon Pix ' ' and especially ' ' You Are Free ' ' ; she 's just expanding on that instinct and adding a more hopeful songwriting bent . ' ' Magnet ' ' commented that this is easily her fullest-sounding , most animated record to date , awarding the album 4 stars out of 5 . Similarly , Drowned in Sound reviewer Hayley Avron referred to ' ' Sun ' ' as the most rounded and accomplished album of Cat Power 's career , elaborating that it seemed that she may have reached a creative peak with ' ' The Greatest ' ' , which signified a definitive leap in her musical evolution . That wheel kept on turning though , and ' ' Sun ' ' marks an even bolder step forward ; the songs sound light and layered with space and sound and is rich with an air of experimentation , with none of the pitfalls of amateurism that often accompany such forays into musical exploration . ' ' Rolling Stone ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most emotionally intense songwriters around , but with ' ' Sun ' ' she has made her riskiest , most vital album , not to mention one of her greatest . Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly stated that Marshall has never sounded more confident or in control than she does on ' ' Sun ' ' , awarding the album a grade of A. James Skinner of BBC Music gave the album a positive review , noting that if there is nothing here as instantly transfixing as some of her past work , ' ' Sun ' ' comes alive on closer listening , revealing myriad depths and unexpected vocal turns . Consequence of Sound editor Sarah Grant called ' ' Sun ' ' a passionate pop album of electronic music filtered through a singer-songwriter 's soul , while ' ' The Fly ' ' reviewer Sophie Thomsett said that the album has transformation and catharsis seeping through every note , before summarising that at its peak , ' ' Sun ' ' reaches greatness , specifically with both Manhattan and the 11-minute opus ' Nothin ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best material she 's ever penned , with both writers awarding the album 4.5 out of 5 stars . Stephen Deusner of ' ' Paste ' ' said that the album was absolutely fascinating in its humanity and compassion , awarding the album 8.0 out of 10 . Matthew Foster of The Quietus , in a positive review , said that ' ' Sun ' ' is about as cathartic as pop gets and described the album as the light at the end of one hell of a tunnel , a record brimming with an assurance and playfulness . Anna Wilson of ' ' Clash ' ' rated it six out of ten and said the album was a robust , respectable detour , but will leave some fans pining for the smoky chanteuse of old . Andy Gill of ' ' The Independent ' ' commented on Marshall 's change in musical direction , saying that she abandoned her soul charm for something much less appealing , while claiming that the overdubbing process turns tracks like Nothin ' But Time into trudges , awarding the album 3 stars out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin Trunick said that the album is n't likely to land among the singer-songwriter 's best records , but it 's clear , however , that her heart went into it , rating the album 3 out of 5. # Accolades # The album was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications . ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' magazine , in their list of the 50 Best Albums of 2012 , ranked it at sixteenth place , writing the idea of the brilliantly morose Chan Marshall making a dance-rock record is almost absurd . Yet the groove-powered ' ' Sun ' ' is a perfect fit . The A.V. Club placed the album at number twenty-two on their list of the Best Albums of 2012 . Billboard also placed the album at number nine in their list of the 10 Best Albums of 2012 . ' ' The L.A. Times ' ' and ' ' Filter ' ' magazine both placed the album at number six in their lists of the best albums of 2012 .
