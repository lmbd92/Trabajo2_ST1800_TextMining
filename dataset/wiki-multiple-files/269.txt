@@763514 The armistice between the Allies and Germany known as the Armistice of Compigne after the location it was signed was the agreement that ended the fighting in western Europe that comprised the First World War . It went into effect at 11 a.m . Paris time on 11 November 1918 , and marked a victory for the Allies and a complete defeat for Germany , although not technically a surrender . The Germans were responding to the policies proposed by American president Woodrow Wilson in his Fourteen Points of January 1918 . The actual terms , largely written by French Marshal Ferdinand Foch , included the cessation of hostilities , the withdrawal of German troops to behind their own borders , the preservation of infrastructure , the exchange of prisoners , a promise of reparations , the disposition of German warships and submarines , and conditions for prolonging or terminating the armistice . Although the armistice ended the actual fighting , it took six months of negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty , the Treaty of Versailles . # October 1918 telegrams # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the liberal Prince Maximilian of Baden was appointed Chancellor of Germany ( German Reich ) In late October , Ludendorff , in a sudden change of mind , declared the conditions of the Allies unacceptable . He now demanded to resume the war which he himself had declared lost only one month earlier . However the German soldiers were pressing to get home . It was scarcely possible to arouse their readiness for battle anew , and desertions were on the increase . The Imperial Government stayed on course and Ludendorff was replaced by Wilhelm Groener . On 5 November , the Allies agreed to take up negotiations for a truce , now also demanding reparation payments . The latest note from Wilson was received in Berlin on 6 November . That same day , the delegation led by Matthias Erzberger departed for France . Also on 9 November , Max von Baden handed over the office of Chancellor to Friedrich Ebert , a Social Democrat . Ebert 's SPD and Erzberger 's Catholic Centre Party had enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the Imperial government since Bismarck 's era in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Imperial Reichstag , which had little power over the government , and had been calling for a negotiated peace since 1917 . Their prominence in the peace negotiations would cause the new Weimar Republic to lack legitimacy in right-wing and militarist eyes . # Negotiation process # The Armistice was the result of a hurried and desperate process . The German delegation headed by Matthias Erzberger crossed the front line in five cars and was escorted for ten hours across the devastated war zone of Northern France , arriving on the morning of 8 November . They were then entrained and taken to the secret destination , aboard Ferdinand Foch 's private train parked in a railway siding in the forest of Compigne . Foch appeared only twice in the three days of negotiations : on the first day , to ask the German delegation what they wanted , and on the last day , to see to the signatures . The Germans were handed the list of Allied demands and given 72 hours to agree . The German delegation discussed the Allied terms not with Foch , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete German demilitarization ( see list below ) , with few promises made by the Allies in return . The naval blockade of Germany was not completely lifted until complete peace terms could be agreed upon . There was no question of negotiation . The Germans were able to correct a few impossible demands ( for example , the decommissioning of more submarines than their fleet possessed ) , extended the schedule for the withdrawal and registered their formal protest at the harshness of Allied terms . But they were in no position to refuse to sign . On Sunday 10 November , they were shown newspapers from Paris to inform them that the Kaiser had abdicated . That same day , Erzberger was instructed to sign by Ebert . The cabinet had earlier received a message from Hindenburg , requesting that the armistice be signed even if the Allied conditions could not be improved on . The Armistice was agreed at 5am on 11 November , to come into effect at 11am Paris time ( 12 noon German time ) , for which reason the occasion is sometimes referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleventh month . Signatures were made between 5:12 am and 5:20 am , Paris time . # Allied Rhineland Occupation # The occupation of the Rhineland took place following the Armistice . The occupying armies consisted of American , Belgian , British and French forces . # Prolongation # The Armistice was prolonged three times before peace was finally ratified . *First Armistice ( 11 November 1918 13 December 1918 ) *First prolongation of the armistice ( 13 December 1918 16 January 1919 ) *Second prolongation of the armistice ( 16 January 1919 16 February 1919 ) *Third prolongation of the armistice ( 16 February 1919 10 January 1920 ) Peace was ratified at 4:15 pm on 10 January 1920. # The Armistice Carriage ( railroad car ) # The armistice was signed in a carriage of Foch 's private train , CIWL #2419 ( Compigne Wagon ) . It was later put back into regular service with the ' ' Compagnie des Wagons-Lits ' ' , but after a short period it was withdrawn to be attached to the French presidential train . From April 1921 to April 1927 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . In November 1927 , it was ceremonially returned to the forest in the exact spot where the Armistice was signed . Marshal Foch , General Weygand and many others watched it being placed in a specially constructed building : the ' ' Clairiere de lArmistice ' ' . There it remained , a monument to the defeat of the Kaiser 's Germany , until 22 June 1940 , when swastika-bedecked German staff cars bearing Adolf Hitler , Hermann Gring , Wilhelm Keitel , Joachim von Ribbentrop and others swept into the Clairiere and , in that same carriage , demanded and received the surrender armistice from France . During the Occupation of France , the Clairiere de lArmistice was destroyed and the carriage taken to Berlin , where it was exhibited in the Lustgarten . After the Allied advance into Germany in early 1945 , the carriage was removed by the Germans for safe keeping to the town of Ohrdruf , but as an American armoured column entered the town , the detachment of the SS guarding it set it ablaze , and it was destroyed . Some pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also exhibited at Compigne . After the war , the Compigne site was restored , but not until Armistice Day 1950 was a replacement carriage , correct in every detail , re-dedicated : an identical Compagnie des Wagon-Lits carriage , no. 2439 , built in 1913 in the same batch as the original and present in 1918 , was renumbered no. 2419D. # Key personnel # For the Allies , the personnel involved were entirely military : *Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch , the Allied supreme commander *General Maxime Weygand , Foch 's chief of staff ( later French commander-in-chief in 1940 ) *First Sea Lord Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss , the British representative *Rear-Admiral George Hope , Deputy First Sea Lord *Captain John Marriott , British naval officer Naval Assistant to the First Sea Lord For Germany : *Matthias Erzberger , a civilian politician . *Count , from the Foreign Ministry *Major General , army *Captain Ernst Vanselow , navy General Weygand and General von Gruennel are not mentioned in the French copy of the armistice document . # Terms # Among its 35 terms , the armistice contained the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in air within six hours of signature . * Immediate removal of all German troops from France , Belgium , Luxembourg , and Alsace-Lorraine within 14 days * Subsequent removal of all German troops from territory on the west side of the Rhine plus 30 km radius bridgeheads of the right side of the Rhine at the cities of Mainz , Koblenz , and Cologne with ensuing occupation by Allied and US troops . * Removal of all German troops on the eastern frontTurkey , Austro-Hungaria and Romaniato German territory as it was on 1 August 1914 .

An official communique was published by the United States at 2:30 pm : In accordance with the terms of the Armistice , hostilities on the fronts of the American armies were suspended at eleven o'clock this morning . News of the armistice being signed was officially announced towards 9 am in Paris . One hour later , Foch , accompanied by a British admiral , presented himself at the Ministry of War , where he was immediately received by Georges Clemenceau , the Prime Minister of France . At 10:50 am , Foch issued this general order : Hostilities will cease on the whole front as from November 11 at 11 o'clock French time The Allied troops will not , until further order , go beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five minutes later , Clemenceau , Foch and the British admiral went to the lyse Palace . At the first shot fired from the Eiffel Tower , the Ministry of War and the lyse Palace displayed flags , while bells around Paris rang . Five hundred students gathered in front of the Ministry and called upon Clemenceau , who appeared on the balcony . Clemenceau exclaimed Vive la France ! the crowd echoed him . At 11:00 am , the first peace-gunshot was fired from Fort Mont-Valrien , which told the population of Paris that the armistice was concluded , but the population were already aware of it from official circles and newspapers . Although the information about the imminent ceasefire had spread among the forces at the front in the hours before , fighting in many sections of the front continued right until the appointed hour . At 11 am there was some spontaneous fraternization between the two sides . But in general , reactions were muted . A British corporal reported : ... the Germans came from their trenches , bowed to us and then went away . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate , except cookies . The peace between the Allies and Germany was subsequently settled in 1919 , by the Paris Peace Conference , and the Treaty of Versailles that same year . # Last casualties # Many artillery units continued to fire on German targets to avoid having to haul away their spare ammunition . The Allies also wished to ensure that , should fighting restart , they would be in the most favourable position . Consequently there were 10,944 casualties of which 2,738 men died on the last day of the war . An example of the determination of the Allies to maintain pressure until the last minute , but also to adhere strictly to the Armistice terms , was Battery 4 of the US Navy 's long-range 14-inch railway guns firing its last shot at 10:57:30 am from the Verdun area , timed to land far behind the German front line just before the scheduled Armistice . Augustin Trbuchon was the last Frenchman to die when he was shot on his way to tell fellow soldiers that hot soup would be served after the ceasefire . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK to die , George Edwin Ellison of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers , was killed earlier that morning at around 9:30 am while scouting on the outskirts of Mons , Belgium . The final Canadian , and Commonwealth , soldier to die , Private George Lawrence Price , was shot and killed by a sniper just two minutes before the armistice to the north of Mons at 10:58 am , to be recognized as one of the last killed with a monument to his name . And finally , American Henry Gunther is generally recognized as the last soldier killed in action in World War I. He was killed 60 seconds before the armistice came into force while charging astonished German troops who were aware the Armistice was nearly upon them . # Legacy # Celebration of the Armistice became the centrepiece of memories of the war , along with salutes to the unknown soldier . Nations built monuments to the dead and the heroic soldiers , but seldom to the generals and admirals. 11 November is commemorated annually in many countries under various names such as Armistice Day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The myth that the German army was stabbed in the back , by the Social Democratic government that was formed in November 1918 , was created by reviews in the German press that grossly misrepresented general Frederick Barton Maurice 's book , ' ' The Last Four Months ' ' . Ludendorff made use of the reviews to convince Hindenburg.
