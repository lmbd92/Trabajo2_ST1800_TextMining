At the same time , six externally similar locomotives employing hydraulic transmission were ordered for comparison , these becoming Class 22 . Repeat orders resulted in a total of 58 of the diesel-electric locomotives being built ( numbered D61006157 ) . They were delivered between December 1958 and November 1960. # Operation # # Eastern Region # The first 38 locomotives entered service in 1958-59 from the Eastern Region depots at Stratford , Hornsey and Ipswich engine shed on commuter services into London , where they were evaluated against rival designs from English Electric , British Railways , Birmingham RC&amp;W and Brush . They were only used in this area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scottish Region at Glasgow Eastfield. # Scottish Region # The final 20 locomotives had uprated engines and were delivered to Kittybrewster depot on the Scottish Region . They were joined on the Scottish Region by the first 38 locos , which were allocated to Glasgow Eastfield depot , close to the North British factory at Springburn where they had been built . They were used widely across the Scottish Region on a range of work , freight , local passenger and express passenger , the latter sometimes in pairs . # Problems # They proved to be unreliable in service , and by the end of 1960 the Eastern Region fleet was transferred to Eastfield depot on the Scottish Region for convenience of return to their manufacturer when warranty work was required . However , the North British Locomotive Works closed in 1962 , by which time the type 's principal shortcomings had become plain . In particular there were problems with the coupling between the power unit and the generator . The engines themselves were a MAN B&amp;W Diesel # Rebuilding # In an attempt to improve reliability 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D6119 , D6121 , D6123 , D6124 , D6129 , D6130 , D6133 , D6134 and D6137 ) , were re-engined between 1963 and 1965 with Paxman Ventura engines to form Class 29. # Withdrawal # The remaining 38 locomotives retained their original NBL/MAN engines until they were withdrawn from service between December 1967 and August 1968 and sold for scrap . Most were cut up by Scottish scrap dealers McWilliams of Shettleston or Barnes and Bell of Coatbridge , but locomotive D6122 was sold to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry , Vale of Glamorgan , South Wales , where it languished until 1980 before being broken up . None have survived . # Notes # # Sources # *Ian Allan ABC of British Railways Locomotives , summer 1966 edition * * * *
