The attack left Capone terrified and he offered a truce between the two gangs . Peace talks faltered on the concessions that the North Siders demanded . As the gang war continued , the North Side Gang started to weaken . Three weeks after the Hawthorne Hotel attack , Hymie Weiss was murdered by a Capone hit squad . Moran now took over the gang .
