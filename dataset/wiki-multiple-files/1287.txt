@@7665514 Etel Adnan ( born 24 February 1925 in Beirut , Lebanon ) is a Lebanese-American poet , essayist , and visual artist . In 2003 ' ' MELUS ' ' , the journal of the Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States , called Adnan arguably the most celebrated and accomplished Arab American author writing today . She currently lives between Paris , France and Sausalito , California . # Life # Etel Adnan was born in 1925 in Beirut , Lebanon . Adnan 's mother was a Christian Greek from Smyrna and her father was Muslim Syrian and a petty officer . Though she grew up speaking Greek and Turkish in a primarily Arabic-speaking society , she was educated at French convent schools and French became the language in which her early work was first written . She also studied English in her youth , and most of her later work has been first written in this language . At twenty-four Adnan traveled to Paris where she received a degree in philosophy from the Sorbonne . She then traveled to America where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkeley and at Harvard University . From 1952 to 1978 , she taught philosophy of art at the Dominican University of California in San Rafael . She has also lectured at many universities throughout the United States . Adnan returned from America to Lebanon and worked as a journalist and cultural editor for ' ' Al-Safa ' ' , a French-language newspaper in Beirut , Lebanon . In addition , she also helped build the cultural section of the newspaper , occasionally contributing cartoons and illustrations . Her tenure at Al-Safa was most notable for her front-page editorials , commenting on the important political issues of the day . Caught between languages , in her youth Adnan first found her voice through painting rather than writing . ' ' MELUS ' ' calls Adnan 's life a study in displacement and alienation . In 1996 she recalled , Abstract art was the equivalent of poetic expression ; I did n't need to use words , but colors and lines . I did n't need to belong to a language-oriented culture but to an open form of expression . She has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ArabAmerican can not be confined to his or her fellow Arabs . Books have a life of their own and no one can determine their fate . The only thing we can strive for consciously is to be aware of the existence of a growing body of ArabAmerican literature , try to know it and make it known . In her later years Adnan began to openly identify as lesbian. # Written Works # # In English # * ' ' Sitt Marie Rose : A Novel ' ' ( 1978 ) **6;168959;br Written in French , the novel was translated into English in 1982 . It was inspired by the true story of a woman killed in the Lebanese Civil War by a childhood friend who had become a member of the right-wing Christian Kataeb Party party . Because of its controversial nature , the Arabic translation of the book was not marketed in Christian East Beirut . The novel criticizes the violence both of a Christianity that is not in actual communication with any force other than the Dragon and an Islam forgets all too often that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be expressed by human mercy . * ' ' When it 's Naked ' ' , Sausalito , CA : The Post-Apollo Press , 1993. * ' ' Master of the Eclipse ' ' ( 2009 ) * ' ' Seasons ' ' ( 2008 ) * ' ' In the Heart of the Heart of Another Country ' ' ( 2005 ) * ' ' In/somnia ' ' ( 2002 ) * ' ' There : In the Light and the Darkness of the Self and of the Other ' ' ( 1997 ) * ' ' To Write in a Foreign Language ' ' ( 1996 ) * ' ' Of Cities and Women , Letters to Fawwaz ' ' ( 1993 ) * ' ' Paris , When It 's Naked ' ' ( 1993 ) * ' ' The Spring Flowers Own and the Manifestations of the Voyage ' ' ( 1990 ) * ' ' The Arab Apocalypse ' ' ( 1989 ) * ' ' Journey to Mount Tamalpais : An Essay ' ' ( 1985 ) * ' ' The Indian Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) * ' ' From A to Z Poetry ' ' ( 1982 ) # In Arabic # * ' ' al-Sitt Mari Ruz : riwayah .
