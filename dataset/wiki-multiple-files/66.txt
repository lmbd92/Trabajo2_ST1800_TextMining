The borough was formed as New Shrewsbury by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on August 15 , 1950 , based on the results of a referendum held on July 18 , 1950 , after breaking away from Shrewsbury Township . It was renamed Tinton Falls in 1975 , to avoid postal errors . The name came from Lewis Morris 's plantation , Tinton Manor , which employed free white workers and slaves . The borough is home to the highest waterfall on New Jersey 's coastal plain . # History # The area that is now known as Tinton Falls was originally settled in the late 1600s , probably beginning with the initial land purchases from the Lenni Lenape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were likely the incentives that encouraged settlement : shortly after the land was purchased , a man by the name of James Grover had an ironworks built along the river . Grover was likely the founder of the community , which , in the 1600s , was named New Shrewsbury . At this time , the waterfall was known to be about high ; erosion and the destruction of the dam near the ironworks have led to its diminishment. # The ironworks # Grovers ironworks was the central fixture of the community , and it was one of the oldest built in the country , predated only by buildings in Jamestown and Massachusetts . In 1675 , a half-interest in the ironworks company was purchased by Colonel Lewis Morris , who obtained a title granting him 3540 acre along the Shrewsbury River . Morris also obtained land owned by Bartholomew Applegate , who had built a corn mill on the other side of the river . Morris , who procured the land for iron mining , named his holdings Tintern Manor , after his family lands in Monmouthshire , England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often accepted as the namesake of Tinton Falls . In 1691 , Colonel Morris died , leaving Tinton Manor ( a corruption of Tintern Manor ) and the ironworks to his nephew of the same name . By 1714 , the ironworks had become less profitable , but mention of a Tinton Falls ironworks can be found as late as 1844. # Separation from Shrewsbury Township # In 1693 , Tinton Manor and the surrounding lands were defined as part of Shrewsbury Township . At this time , Shrewsbury included all of the land in eastern Monmouth County . Shrewsbury Township became Shrewsbury Borough in 1926 , after many of the municipalities in eastern Monmouth County split from the township . In July 1950 , Tinton Falls and Wayside left Shrewsbury Borough , renaming themselves the Borough of New Shrewsbury . To avoid postal confusion and mix-ups with the surrounding borough and township of Shrewsbury , the residents of New Shrewsbury voted to rename the community as The Borough of Tinton Falls in 1975. # Geography # Tinton Falls is located at ( 40.266688 , -74.098746 ) .
