The department serves a population of more than 730,000 people . The chief is Dr. Cedric Alexander . # History # The DeKalb County Police Department was founded on December 18 , 1915 . On two occasions , in 1923 and 1931 , the department was eliminated , as the county commissioners felt that the department was not serving the best interests of the public . In both cases the department was quickly reinstated . In the early years the department had only a handful of officers . Hiring was sporadic , there was no chief , and officers worked out of the DeKalb County Solicitor 's Office . From the department 's inception until the end of prohibition in 1933 , a DeKalb County Police officer 's primary responsibility was to apprehend bootleggers . Officers Samuel Gentry , Lewell Henderson , Miles Phillips , and Charles Wright were all killed in incidents involving suspected bootleggers . At the beginning of the 1940s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under County Commissioner Scott Candler , a program was started to expand and better train and equip the department , starting with the introduction of two-way car radios . The radio system afforded officers greater mobility and increased their effectiveness , before the radio system , officers had to regularly call in from pay phones for instructions . The radios , along with the addition of a new fleet of patrol cars in 1949 allowed officers to quickly respond to calls , that same year DeKalb Police moved into headquarters located in the county complex on Camp drive.in the 1950s the department added more officers , formed Traffic Enforcement , Criminal Investigation , and a Records and Identification section , and responsibilities between the Sheriff and the Police Dept. were more clearly defined . By 1960 the department had grown to over 100 officers , and efforts were made for Dekalb to organize their own Academy . By 1968 , the department had expanded to a force of approximately 200 officers , and added new Specialized Investigation units such as Robbery/Homicide , Juvenile and Narcotics to the Dept . In 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received their first Helicopter , a Hughes model 300C when the Dept. moved into a newly built public safety complex on Camp Circle in Decatur which when constructed had a Helipad installed on the roof . The department would remain at this location for more than thirty years . The location is still the home to several units within the police department.by the mid 70 's the Dept , formed a SWAT unit , combined several investigative functions into a Major Felony Unit , and fielded mobile Crime Scene , Accident Reconstruction and Community relations units.massive growth in Dekalb required the ranks to expand to over 500 officers . In 2006 the DeKalb County Police department had outgrew its headquarters and moved to its current headquarters at 1960 W. Exchange Place in Tucker . As metropolitan Atlanta grew , so did the DeKalb County Police Department . In the last forty years , DKPD has expanded from 200 officers to its current staff of 1,112 sworn officers and 498 support staff ( as of 2011 ) making it the second largest police department in Georgia . With the incorporation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of Brookhaven in 2013 , most of North Precinct 's patrol area was absorbed into these cities . As a result , the precinct was closed on August 17 , 2013 , reducing the department 's total number of precincts from five to four . The murder of Officer William David Corn on February 1 , 1972 is the agency 's only unsolved police murder . # Specialized units # The following is a partial list of specialized units within the department : Traffic Specialist Unit ( TSU ) : Responsible for investigating traffic fatalities and hit-and-runs .

Bolton had previously been the chief of the Dallas Police Department , and was terminated by that agency in 2003 . Bolton 's tenure with the DeKalb Police was fraught with controversy . The chief was accused of taking unauthorized time off work and misusing luxury vehicles seized by the department . In February 2009 , under mounting pressure from the media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected county CEO Burrell Ellis placed Bolton on administrative leave . Bolton was terminated shortly after being placed on leave . In a letter sent to Bolton , Ellis outlined his reasons for terminating the chief . The letter provided examples of Bolton 's insubordination , misuse of county property , and conduct unbecoming an officer . Major William O'Brien , a 24-year veteran of the department , was named acting chief after Bolton was placed on administrative leave . Bolton appealed his termination , and an employment hearing was held in June 2009 . The hearing was expected to end on June 11 , but was continued to July 15 , 2009 . On August 17 , 2009 , Hearing Officer Phyllis Williams released a ruling which upheld Bolton 's termination . # Accreditation # The DeKalb County Police Department has been accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies ( CALEA ) since 1991. # Chiefs and directors # * Chief B.M.
