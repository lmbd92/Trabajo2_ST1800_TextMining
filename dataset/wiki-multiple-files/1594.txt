This area of fertile land with many market gardens was referred to as ' Old Market ' from the 15th century . In the 13th century , the area was enclosed by a defensive ditch , with Lawfords Gate at the eastern end separating it from West Street . The ditch marked the boundary of the town of Bristol . The area was characterised by long narrow plots of land , some of which survive today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local taxes , and became a place of inns , low lodgings , squatters and outlaws . Old Market Street prospered as Bristols trade grew , developing into a 370 m long street connecting the East Gate of the Castle with Lawfords Gate , wide in its middle section and narrowing for the gates . In the 15th and 16th century , the area grew in importance and became the site of almshouses and manufacture , as well as houses , inns and shops . Old Market did not fare well in the English Civil War . During the Parliamentarian attack on Lawfords Gate , much of West Street may have been destroyed , and buildings to the east of Lawfords Gate may have been demolished to give the Royalists a clear defensive line of fire . Following the Civil War much of the area was redeveloped . The Castle was demolished and with it the East Gate ; Old Market Street and Castle Street became a major commercial axis .

Old Market became an important tram terminus , serving areas to the east , north-west and south of the city . By now it was also a well-established shopping street , connecting seamlessly with Castle Street . Parts of the area were affected by slum clearance programmes in the 1930s , but it was the severance caused by the destruction of Castle Street together with the building of Temple Way Underpass ( which obliterated the western end of Old Market Street ) that sent the area into near-terminal decline . Some businesses relocated to Broadmead ; others closed . Large parts of the area were zoned for redevelopment , and the area was severely blighted .
