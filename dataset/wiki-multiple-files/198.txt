Deedes began his career as a reporter on the ' ' Morning Post ' ' in 1931 , joining the ' ' Daily Telegraph ' ' when it took over the ' ' Post ' ' in 1937 . Between 1931 and the beginning of the war in 1939 , he shared a home in Bethnal Green , with his uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an officer in the 2nd Battalion of The Queen 's Westminsters , one of the territorial units of the King 's Royal Rifle Corps , gaining the Military Cross near Hengelo , The Netherlands in April 1945 .

His son , Jeremy Deedes , is a director of the Telegraph Group of companies and a director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tote , Chairman of The Sportsman newspaper , and is currently a director of Warwick Racecourse . Lucy Deedes is a former Master of Foxhounds and was the first wife of Crispin Money-Coutts , the 9th Baron Latymer . She is the mother of society magician Drummond Money-Coutts. # Politics # Deedes came from a family with a tradition of public service . He was very proud of the fact that there had been a Deedes member of parliament in every century since 1600 . Deedes was elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Ashford in 1950 . First serving as a junior minister under Winston Churchill for three years , he later entered Harold Macmillan 's Cabinet in 1962 as Minister without Portfolio . He left the Cabinet in 1964 , as Minister of Information , and subsequently stood down as an MP at the October 1974 election . # Journalism and later life # He was Editor of ' ' The Daily Telegraph ' ' from 1974 to 1986 , and after he was replaced by Max Hastings , continued his career as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the print unions . Deedes was made a life peer in 1986 , becoming Baron Deedes , of Aldington in the County of Kent , though he always preferred to be addressed as Bill rather than Lord Deedes . Bill Deedes continued to comment on social and political issues through his newspaper columns up to his death . In his later years , he gained a cult fanbase after two memorable appearances on ' ' Have I Got News For You ' ' becoming , at the age of 88 , the oldest guest ever to have appeared on the programme until 2012 when Baroness Trumpington appeared at the age of 90 .

The residential street , Bill Deedes Way , in the village of Aldington near Ashford , is named after him . # Popular culture # # Dear Bill # Deedes was close to Margaret Thatcher and her husband Denis . The spoof letters from Mr. Thatcher which appeared in satirical magazine ' ' Private Eye ' ' throughout the Thatcher years were always addressed to ' ' Dear Bill ' ' - the Bill in question was usually assumed to be Deedes ; however some instalments ( e.g. 16 May and 28 November 1986 ) would suggest otherwise . The two men regularly played golf together , with Deedes claiming it was a public service to take the spouse of the Prime Minister away from the stress of being married to the country 's head of government . The ' ' Eye ' ' also based its long-running editorial comment , Shome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Scoop # According to many sources , Deedes was the journalist used by Evelyn Waugh as the model and inspiration for the hapless William Boot , protagonist of the satirical novel ' ' Scoop ' ' . Deedes himself said he spent part of my life brushing aside the charge , but admitted that my inexperience and naivety as a reporter in Africa might have contributed a few bricks to the building of Boot . The two had reported together in 1936 , trying to cover the Second Italo-Abyssinian War ; Deedes arrived in Addis Ababa aged 22 with almost 600 pounds of luggage . Berhanu Kebele , Ethiopian ambassador , to London , pointed out that Deedes 's sharp journalistic instincts ensured Italian excesses were kept in the public eye . Barring the question of age , a more appropriate model for Boot is William Beach Thomas who , according to Peter Stothard , was a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous Daily Mail war correspondent in World War I. # Publications # * Deedes , WF , ' ' Words and Deedes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISBN 1-4050-5396-8 * Deedes , WF , ' ' At War with Waugh : The Real Story of Scoop ' ' , Macmillan , 2003 ISBN 1-4050-0573-4 * Deedes , WF , ' ' Brief Lives ' ' , Macmillan , 2004 ISBN 0-330-42639-7 * Deedes , WF , ' ' Dear Bill : A Memoir ' ' , Macmillan , 2005 ISBN 1-4050-5266-X * Deedes , WF &amp; Wake , Sir Hereward ( eds . ) , ' ' Swift and Bold : the story of the King 's Royal Rifle Corps in the Second World War 1939-1945 ' ' , Gale and Polden , Aldershot , 1949 # Notes #
