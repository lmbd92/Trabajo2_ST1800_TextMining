@@13515514 George Eld ( died 1624 ) was a London printer of the Jacobean era , who produced important works of English Renaissance drama and literature , including key texts by William Shakespeare , Ben Jonson , Christopher Marlowe , and Thomas Middleton . Eld was the son of a carpenter from Derbyshire . He served an eight-year apprenticeship to bookseller Robert Bolton , starting in 1592 , and became a freeman ( a full member ) of the Stationers Company on 13 January 1600 . He established himself in his own printing business in 1604 , at the sign of the White Horse in Fleet Lane , by marrying the widow of not one but two master printers . His shop featured two or perhaps three presses , and four compositors -- a substantial operation for the time . Eld entered into a partnership with Miles Fletcher in 1617 ; Fletcher took over the business once Eld died of plague in 1624. # Printer # In Eld 's historical era , most stationers concentrated on either printing or bookselling ; and most publishing was done by the booksellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eld was primarily a printer during his career , working on specific projects for specific booksellers . In his two-decade career , Eld printed a wide variety of works ; when the printer is identified on title pages only with initials , researchers have used Eld 's characteristic title-page device , two volutes with foliage , for supporting evidence . He is the G. E. who printed William Camden 's ' ' Remains of a Greater Work ' ' ( 1605 ) for Simon Waterson , John Selden 's ' ' The Duello ' ' ( 1610 ) for John Helme , and Peter Gosselin 's ' ' The State Mysteries of the Jesuits ' ' ( 1623 ) for Nicholas Bourne . # Thorpe # Eld worked regularly for Thomas Thorpe ; the two produced more than twenty titles together . These included the first quartos of Jonson 's ' ' Sejanus ' ' ( 1605 ) , ' ' Volpone ' ' ( 1606 ) , and ' ' The Masque of Blackness ' ' and ' ' The Masque of Beauty ' ' ( in one volume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What You Will ' ' ( 1607 ) , and George Chapman 's ' ' All Fools ' ' ( 1605 ) and ' ' The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles , Duke of Byron ' ' ( 1608 ) . Thorpe and Eld were also involved in two dubious publishing enterprises -- one , a failed attempt to print a work to which they did not have the rights , and the other , a successful piracy of some work by Thomas Coryat. # Shakespeare # Thorpe and Eld 's most significant project was the 1609 first edition of Shakespeare 's Sonnets . In 1612 , Thorpe and Eld also issued a work of modern Shakespearean controversy , the ' ' Funeral Elegy ' ' that Donald Foster proposed as a work by Shakespeare , without convincing most scholars and critics . More Shakespeare : Eld printed the 1609 quarto of ' ' Troilus and Cressida , ' ' for Richard Bonian and Henry Walley . Some critics have complained that the text in this volume is so poor that it should be classed as a bad quarto ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how much is due to a faulty manuscript source that Eld had to work with , is open to question . ( Eld 's ' ' Sejanus ' ' text , in contrast , is excellently printed . ) Eld has also been identified as the printer of John Smethwick 's third quarto of ' ' Hamlet ' ' ( 1611 in literature ) . # Others # Eld also printed the 1619 second quarto of Marlowe 's ' ' Doctor Faustus ' ' for John Wright . And for William Aspley , he printed one of the most controversial plays of the period , ' ' Eastward Ho ' ' ( three editions , 1605 ) . Eld printed first editions of a range of other texts in Jacobean drama : * Samuel Daniel 's ' ' The Queen 's Arcadia ' ' ( 1606 ) , for publisher Simon Waterson . * The anonymous ' ' Return from Parnassus ' ' ( 1606 ) , for John Wright . * The anonymous ' ' Caesar 's Revenge ' ' ( 1606 ) , also for John Wright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ( 1607 ) , again for John Wright . * Day , Rowley , and Wilkins 's ' ' The Travels of the Three English Brothers ' ' ( 1607 ) , once again for Wright . * Thomas Tomkis 's ' ' Lingua ' ' ( 1607 ) , for Simon Waterson . * Lording Barry 's ' ' Ram Alley ' ' ( 1611 ) , for Robert Wilson . * Chapman 's ' ' The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln 's Inn ' ' ( 1613 ) , for George Norton . * Nathan Field 's ' ' Amends for Ladies ' ' ( 1618 ) , for Matthew Walbancke. # Publisher # Like some printers of his generation -- Richard Field is a good example -- Eld also published work on his own authority . He was active in drama here too : * Eld printed and published both Q1 and Q2 of ' ' The Revenger 's Tragedy ' ' ( 1607 and 1608 ) . The play is now generally attributed to Middleton . * Also , Middleton 's ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' again the first two quartos ( both 1608 ) . A printer who published usually had to arrange for a bookseller to sell the work in question ; the title page of Q2 of ' ' A Trick ' ' specifies that the book is to be sold by Henry Rocket . Yet when the third edition of ' ' A Trick ' ' appeared in 1616 , Eld was no longer the publisher ; he merely printed the volume for bookseller Thomas Langley . * ' ' The Puritan , ' ' one of the plays of the Shakespeare Apocrypha , was published by Eld in 1607 . Another play now generally assigned to Middleton , Eld attributed it to W. S. * Eld published ' ' Northward Ho , ' ' by Thomas Dekker and John Webster , in 1607 . Eld published beyond the confines of Jacobean drama as well , with works like John Healey 's 1610 translation of ' ' The City of God ' ' by St. Augustine . ( That volume bore a dedication to William Herbert , 3rd Earl of Pembroke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of satires by John Taylor the Water Poet called ' ' The Water Cormorant His Complaint ' ' . He published the types of religious books that were so common in his era , like Bishop Gervase Babington 's ' ' Works , Containing Comfortable Notes on the Five Books of Moses ' ' ( 1615 ) . And inevitably , Eld published and printed many now-obscure works by forgotten authors . The title page of his 1606 edition of Robert Pricket 's ' ' Time 's Anatomy ' ' bears the inscription to be sold by John Hodgets -- another demonstration of the printer/publisher 's need for a retail outlet for his products . # Grimeston # In 1607 , Eld printed and published Edward Grimeston 's ' ' A General Inventory of the History of France , ' ' the book that provided Chapman source material for his tragedies on then-recent French history ( including the Byron plays cited above ) . Eld followed this with several other large histories by Grimeston , partnering with fellow stationers Adam Islip , M. Flesher , and William Stansby : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Islip and G. Eld , 1609 ) , ' ' The General History of Spain ' ' ( A. Islip and G. Eld , 1612 ) , ' ' The General History of the Magnificent State of Venice ' ' ( G. Eld and W. Stansby , 1612 ) , and ' ' A General History of France ' ' ( G. Eld and M. Flesher , 1624 ) .
