@@13089514 The House of Gurieli ( ) was a Georgian royal noble family and a ruling dynasty ( dukes ) of the southwestern Georgian province of Guria which was autonomous and later for a few centuries independent , as well as a few ducal rulers of the dynasty rose in the 17th-18th centuries to be kings of the whole western Caucasus in place of hereditary Bagrationi kings of Imereti . Initially a hereditary title of governors ( Eristavi ) of Guria since the mid-13th century , Gurieli ( literally , of Guria ) was adopted as a dynastic name by the Vardanisdze family ( ) , hereditary rulers of Svaneti ( a highland province in western Georgia ) . The other notable branch of the Vardanisdze was the Dadiani ( ) of Samegrelo . Both of these branches occasionally used double names : Gurieli-Dadiani or Dadiani-Gurieli . The medieval Gurieli were vassals to the Georgian crown , but , at the same time , seem to have paid some kind of homage ( ) to the rulers of the neighboring Empire of Trebizond , whose last emperor , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documented as having been ' gambros ' of Mamia Vardanisdze-Gurieli ( c. 1450 - 69 ) , which is interpreted that Mamia married his daughter or sister or close kinswoman . If the couple had issue , possibly the subsequent ruler Kakhaber ( 146983 ) , the latter-day Gurieli should have descended from several Byzantine and Trapezuntine emperors . In the 1460s , when the power of the Bagrationi Dynasty of Georgia was on the decline , the Gurieli pursued a policy of separation and became virtually ( and even formally acknowledged in occasions ) independent rulers ( mtavari ) of the Principality of Guria in the mid-16th century , but were forced to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire , nominally recognizing also the authority of the princes of Mingrelia and kings of Imereti . Throughout the following two centuries , the politics of the Gurieli dynasty were dominated by the conflicts with the neighboring Georgian rulers , Ottoman inroads , and repeated occasions of civil strife and palace coups . In the 17th and 18th centuries , as many as four Gurieli rulers managed to get chosen kings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Imereti . Gurieli kings ( ephemeral as some of their royal reigns were ) however are usually characterized as usurpers , or as rival dynasty of counter-monarchs . Powerful neighbors also in several occasions managed to change the rulership of Guria itself to other members of the Gurieli dynasty , there were rivalling branches of the family itself . Having accepted Imperial Russian sovereignty in 1810 , the dynasty continued to enjoy some autonomy in their home affairs until 1829 , when the Russian authorities deposed David Gurieli , the last Gurieli , and abolished the Principality of Guria . With the death of David in 1839 , the main male line went extinct . His cousin , David Gurieli ( 18021856 ) , and his descendants ( ) were confirmed in the dignity of Prince ( knyaz ) by the Tsars decree of 1850. # Prince Gurieli Dynasty # * c. 13851410 Kakhaber I ; son of Giorgi II Dadiani ; eristavi of Guria and Svaneti * c. 14101430 Giorgi I ; son of Kakhaber I * c. 14301450 Mamia I ; son of Giorgi I * c. 14501469 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kakhaber II ; possibly son of Mamia II by his Trapezuntine wife * 14831512 Giorgi I ( II ) ; son of Kakhaber II ; sovereign prince from 1491 * 15121534 Mamia I ( III ) ; son of Giorgi I * 15341564 Rostom ; son of Mamia I * 15641583 Giorgi II ( III ) ; son of Rostom ; deposed * 15831587 Vakhtang I ; son of Giorgi II * 15871600 Giorgi II ( III ) ; restored * 16001625 Mamia II ( IV ) ; son of Giorgi II * 1625 Svimon I ; son of Mamia II ; deposed , died after 1672 * 16251658 Kaikhosro I ( III ) ; son of Vakhtang I * 16591668 Demetre ; son of Svimon I ; deposed , died 1668 * 16691684 Giorgi III ( IV ) ; son of Kaikhosro I * 16851689 Kaikhosro II ( IV ) ; son of Giorgi III ** Malak'ia ; son of Kaikhosro I ; rival prince 1685 ; deposed * 16891712 Mamia III ( V ) ; son of Giorgi III ; deposed ** Malak'ia ; restored as rival prince 1689 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( V ) ; son of Mamia III ; deposed * 17121714 Mamia III ( V ) ; restored * 17141716 Giorgi IV ( V ) ; restored ; deposed * 1716 Kaikhosro III ( V ) ; son of Mamia III ; deposed , died after 1716 * 17161726 Giorgi IV ( V ) ; restored * 17261744 Mamia IV ( VI ) ; son of Giorgi IV ; deposed , died 1778 * 1744 Giorgi V ( VI ) ; son of Giorgi IV ; abdicated , died after 1744 * 17441792 Svimon II ; son of Giorgi V ; deposed * 1778c. 1780 Kaikhosro IV ( VI ) ; son of Giorgi V ; abdicated , died after 1820 * c. 17801792 Svimon II ; restored * 17921803 Vakhtang II ; son of Giorgi V ; deposed , died after 1814 * 18031826 Mamia V ( VII ) ; son of Svimon II ** Kaikhosro , brother of Svimon II , regent 1803-1809 * 18261829 Davit ; son of Mamia V ; deposed , died 1839 ** Sophia , mother of Davit , regent 1826-1829 # References #
