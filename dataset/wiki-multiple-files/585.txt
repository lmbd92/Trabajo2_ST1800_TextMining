During this process , he finally found Emily Blunt , and felt her to be the ideal Tamsin . The chemistry between Press and Blunt was perfect right from the start and they first did a tryout with the Pavlova-dancing scene , which worked out perfectly . Emily Blunt is a competent cellist , and is listed in the credits as the performer of The Swan by Camille Saint-Sans . Pawlikowski already knew Paddy Considine from their earlier collaboration ' ' Last Resort ' ' and cast him as Phil . The film was shot during the span of five weeks after some intensive location-scouting by Pawlikowski . The script only contained 35 pages and was far from being complete . The whole script was a kind of work in progress : a lot of scenes and dialogue were improvised while shooting , with a lot of participation by the actors .

The whole shoot was done on location in Todmorden during the hottest summer Yorkshire had seen in 50 years . The score of the film was written by Goldfrapp and the movie theme is a variation of the Goldfrapp song Lovely Head , which was the first song of their 2000 album ' ' Felt Mountain ' ' . The performances of the leading actors have been acclaimed , with awards from the Evening Standard British Film Awards and the London Critics Circle Film Awards . Additionally , Pawlikowski 's unconventional style of directing has been rewarded with a BAFTA for Best British Film and the Michael Powell award for Best British Film at the Edinburgh Film Festival ( where the film had its world premiere in 2004 ) , along with many nominations across the British Independent Film Awards and the European Film Awards .

Most of the characters in the novel were left out in the film and the character Phil was invented and added by Pawlikowski , who had previously directed a documentary on born-again Christians in Yorkshire . In many interviews Pawlikowski said that he was not interested in portraying typical teenage life in England , but he wanted to give the movie a certain timeless feeling . # Release # ' ' My Summer of Love ' ' was first screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival , being released across the UK on 5 November 2004 .
