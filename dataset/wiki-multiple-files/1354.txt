@@8207514 The Bay County Library System , in Bay County , Michigan , was established on January 1 , 1974 after the county electorate approved a 0.7 million dollar tax levy for five years . The Library System brought together three libraries ( The Bay City Public Library and its Broadway Branch , The Sage Library , and The Pinconning Library ) which previously were funded separately and independently by the cities of Bay City and Pinconning . These branches , together with the Auburn Area Branch Library ( established in September 1973 ) , the South Side Branch Library ( formerly the Broadway Branch ) , and the Bookmobile ( which began operation in March 1975 ) would comprise the six service outlets of the Library System . In 2000 , Bay County voters approved a millage increase and bond issue to support capital improvements to the system , including new buildings for the Bay City and Pinconning branches and additions and renovations to the Auburn , Sage , and Southside branches Renovations to the Auburn and Sage branches were completed in the winter and spring of 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October 2004 . In December 2005 the Bay City Branch was replaced by the new Alice and Jack Wirt Public Library . In 2006 , voters twice failed to pass the operating millage required the provided 60 percent of the system 's operating funds . As a result , the Bay County Library Board voted to close the South Side and Sage branch libraries , suspend Bookmobile service , and open the Auburn , Pinconning , and Wirt branches for restricted hours . . The closure of Sage Library suspended its run as the oldest continuously operating library in the state of Michigan . Renovations to the South Side Branch are currently on hold pending resolution of the library 's current operating funding situation In 2007 , voters passed a reduced millage that allowed the Library System to once again open Sage and allow for more hours and services at all branches .
