@@8019514 Antnio Dacosta ( 3 November 1914 in Angra do Herosmo , Azores , Portugal &amp;ndash ; 2 December 1990 , Paris , France ) was a Portuguese painter , poet and art critic and a pioneer of the surrealistic movement in Portugal . # Early life # Although he had no formal art training , Dacosta drew and painted from an early age . He completed his studies at the Angra high school and in 1935 left the Azores to attend the Escola de Belas Artes ( School of Fine Arts ) in Lisbon . Strongly opposed to the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal and horrified by the violence of the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Nationalist victory , his painting took a menacing and surrealistic turn . He displayed his first paintings at Casa Repe in 1940 along with Antnio Pedro and an English sculptor , Pamela Boden . He also showed at the annual national Salon of Modern Art where he won the Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso Prize in 1942 . He became one of the forerunners of the surrealistic movement in Portugal . Many of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studio where he was working . The remaining paintings are owned by private collectors or Portuguese museums . Throughout the 1940s he wrote art criticism for Portuguese newspapers and illustrated books for several contemporary Portuguese authors . # Paris # In 1947 , the French government awarded him a grant to spend a year in Paris , where he stayed for the rest of his life . For the first time , he was in direct contact with original masterpieces as well as the works of contemporary international artists . Post-war creativity was a revelation to him and he began to doubt the importance of his own work . He progressively stopped painting but nonetheless in 1948 sent two paintings to the Surrealist Group Show in Lisbon . In 1952 , his first successful one-man show ( 17 Paintings 1940 1950 ) was held at the Galeria de Maro in Lisbon . By 1953 , he was no longer painting . He became a reporter for a Brazilian newspaper O Estado , writing about the Paris art scene ( theatre , literature and art exhibitions ) . These articles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later published in book-form Dacosta em Paris by Assirio &amp; Alvim ( 1999 ) . Dacosta is today considered a pioneer of Portuguese surrealist art . In the 1950s , many Portuguese artists , including Ren Bertholo , travelled to Paris in search of new ideas and Dacosta became a valuable inspiration for them and a source of information about Parisian artistic life . # Return to Painting # In 1969 Dacosta attended a retrospective of his works from 1939 to 1948 at the Galeria Buchholz in Lisbon and in 1978 his paintings were included in ' ' Portuguese Art since 1910 ' ' at the Royal Academy of London , a show that he visited with his friend and fellow-artist , Jlio Pomar . Rediscovering his earlier works at this show ( he owned none of them ) perhaps gave him an impetus to return to painting . In 1971 he moved with his wife , Miriam Rewald , the gallerist , and two young children to Janville , a small town south of Paris , where he started making little objects , things , as he liked to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Manuel Alves , he timidly acquired painting material . Although he never tried to show his work publicly , word got around as he occasionally showed a new drawing or object to visitors . In the mid-1970s he stopped sending his articles to Brazil and , thanks to a grant from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation , became free to paint . His surrealism disappeared and gave way to a completely new style , devoid of the uneasiness and aura of danger in his earlier works . He also began to utilise pagan-religious images from his childhood in the Azores . A peaceful and mystical element entered his paintings , a very personal style - figurative but not representative . In 1983 a one man show at Galeria 111 in Lisbon revealed his recent paintings , which were all sold to private and public collections . This success encouraged Dacosta to create more work . He was awarded the national art prize by the Portuguese art critics association in 1984 and honoured with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit by Portuguese President , Mrio Soares , in 1988. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisbon ( catalogue text by Fernando Lemos ) *1968 : Foundation Calouste Gulbenkian , Paris . *1969 : Retrospective 1939-1948 , Galeria Buchholz , Lisbon ( catalogue text by Rui Mrio Gonalves ) . *1978 : ' ' Portuguese Art since 1910 ' ' , Royal Academy , London . *1983 : Galeria 111 , Lisbon ( catalogue text by Rui Mrio Gonalves ) *1984 : Galeria Zen , Porto ( catalogue text by Rui Mrio Goncalves ) *1985 : Portuguese pavilion , Biennale of 1985 , So Paulo , Brazil . *1988 : Foundation Calouste Gulbenkian , Paris . *1988 : Centro de arte moderna , Lisbon and Casa de Serralves Museum , Porto ( catalogue texts by Fernando de Azevedo , Maria Helena de Freitas , Rui Mrio Gonalves , Jlio Pomar and Jos Sommer Ribeiro ) . *1995 : Sala Nobre da Secretaria Regional da Educao e Cultura Angra do Herosmo , Azores ( catalogue text by Ruth Rosengarten ) . *1997 : ' ' Antnio Dacosta : peintre et pote portugais ' ' , Maison de la Posie , Paris . *1997 : ' ' Antnio Dacosta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . *1999 : Bermuda National Gallery and New Bedford Museum of Art ( catalogue text by Ruth Rosengarten ) *2006 : Casa de Serralves Museum , Porto . *2007 : ' ' Antnio Dacosta : Scne Ouverte ' ' , Foundation Calouste Gulbenkian , Paris ( catalogue texts by Joo Pedro Garcia , Jos-Luis Porfrio and Alain Tapi ) . # Final Years # He was commissioned to decorate a wall in the new building of the Azorean Government in Horta .
