He owned 10,000 acres ( 40 km ) of peach and apple orchard in over seven Georgia counties and Florida . He was active in agricultural experimentation , developing many new methods that he generously shared with the farming community .

In 1907 he was elected Senator , and in 1909 was re-elected as Representative . Hardman was an active legislator ; he introduced legislation which required public schools to offer basic agricultural courses , established the State Board of Health , provided free treatment for individuals with hydrophobia , utilizing the ' Pasteur method ' , prohibited the production , sale , and consumption of alcohol , considered to be an early victory in the national Prohibition movement , and petitioned the United States Congress to commission a drainage survey for the state .

Harris , and again in 1916 , losing to Hugh M. Dorsey . His third try came in 1926 , against three other candidates . He campaigned on the promise to bring more business-like administration to state government . The election ended up in a run-off with fellow Jackson County politician and chair of the Georgia Highway Department , John Holder of Jefferson . Hardman won the run-off with 228 county unit votes to Holders 132 : a rather narrow victory . He was the oldest elected governor in the state 's history , being 71 at the time of his first election .

As governor , Hardman oversaw the renovation of the Georgia State Capitol building in Atlanta , the procurement of the Rhodes home as a depository for the state archives , and a plant to produce license tags . One of his most significant contributions to the state while in the office of governor was the establishment of a study in governmental efficiency , called the Allen Commission on Simplification and Coordination , headed by prominent Atlanta businessman , Ivan Allen Sr. However , the findings of this commission were not implemented until after Hardman had left office ; the Great Depression dampened any support for the sweeping changes he might have garnered with the General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reorganizations of Hardman 's gubernatorial successor , Richard Russell , Jr .. An interesting anecdote has been told about Governor Hardman : Two men had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death . A third person then confessed that she and the male confederate had actually committed the fatal crime . Lawyers for the two condemned men begged Hardman for a stay of execution until the new evidence could be evaluated . The governor settled the matter by studying photographs of the two men , concluding that they were definitely criminal types , and permitting their executions . Due to his age , Hardman 's terms as governor were plagued by ill-health and fatigue . After completing his two terms , he spent his final years in his home in Commerce ( he was none-too-pleased that Harmony Grove had changed its name some three decades before ) , he died of heart failure at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on February 18 , 1937 .
