@@2010514 Infobox Aircraft Begin Infobox Aircraft Type The Naval Aircraft Factory N3N was a United States two tandem-seat , open cockpit , primary training biplane aircraft built by the Naval Aircraft Factory ( N.A.F. ) in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania during the 1930s. # Development and design # Built to replace the Consolidated NY-2 and NY-3 , the N3N was successfully tested as both a conventional airplane and a seaplane . The seaplane used a single float under the fuselage and floats under the outer tips of the lower wing . The conventional airplane used a fixed landing gear . The prototype XN3N-1 was powered by a radial Wright designed Wright J-5 engine . An order for 179 production aircraft was received . Near the end of the first production run the engine was replaced with the Wright R-760-2 Whirlwind radial . The aircraft is completely metal using bolts and rivets rather than the more common welded steel tubing fuselages . Early production models used aluminum stringers formed for cancelled airship construction orders . # Operational history # The N.A.F. delivered 997 N3N aircraft beginning in .

The N3N was the last biplane in US military service - the last ( used by the U.S. Naval Academy for aviation familiarization ) were retired in 1961 . The N3N was also unique in that it was an aircraft designed and manufactured by an aviation firm wholly owned and operated by the U.S. government ( the Navy , in this case ) as opposed to private industry . For this purpose , the U.S. Navy bought the rights and the tooling for the Wright R-760 series engine and produced their own engines . These Navy built engines were installed on Navy built airframes . Postwar , many surviving aircraft were sold on the US civil aircraft market and bought for operation by agricultural aerial spraying firms and private pilot owners . A number are still ( 2014 ) active in the USA. # Variants # ; XN3N-1 : First prototype aircraft , Bureau of Aeronautics number 9991 . ; N3N-1 : Two-seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Wright J-5 radial piston engine . 179 were built . ; XN3N-2 : One prototype only ( Bureau number 0265 ) powered by a 240-hp ( 179-kW ) Wright R-760-96 radial piston engine . ; XN3N-3 : One production N3N-1 ( 0020 ) was converted into a ' dash three ' prototype . ; N3N-3 : Two-seat primary trainer biplane , powered by a 235-hp ( 175-kW ) Wright R-760-2 Whirlwind 7 radial piston engine . 816 built . # Operators # ; *United States Coast Guard *United States Navy ; *Paraguayan Naval Aviation Two N3N-3s received by Lend-Lease Program . # Aircraft on Display # * National Air and Space Museum - Udvar Hazy Center , Chantilly Virginia * National Museum of Naval Aviation , Pensacola Florida * Kalamazoo Aviation History Museum , Kalamazoo Michigan * USS Lexington Museum , Corpus Christi Texas # Specifications ( N3N-3 ) # Communications were done by the instructor through a speaking tube to the aft-seated student .
