A fishing station sprouted on Thunder Bay Island during this period , and an 1846 gazetteer counted 160 settlers on the island and 31 fishing boats that called the island their home port . Most of these fishing boats were small Mackinaw boats . The total catch is said to have been 12,000 barrels of fish per year . The Thunder Bay Island fishing station supported a small general store . After a few decades , however , the yield of Lake Huron fish declined . The Thunder Bay Island fishing station became a ghost town .
