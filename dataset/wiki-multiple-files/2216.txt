@@17911514 The Shrine of the Cloak ( Pashto : ' ' Kerqa Sharif ' ' ) is located adjacent to the main mosque in Kandahar , Afghanistan . It contains the ' ' Kerqa ' ' , a cloak believed to have been worn by Muhammad . It is therefore widely held to be one of the holiest Islamic sites in Afghanistan , and even considered by some as the heart of Afghanistan . The building 's exteriors are of green marble from Lashkar Gah , with tiled surfaces and gilded archways . The cloak itself is locked away inside the mosque and is rarely seen . It has been guarded by the same family for over 250 years . Its guardians have traditionally only shown the cloak to recognized leaders of Afghanistan , although in times of great crisis such as natural disasters , it has been publicly displayed as a means of reassurance . The cloak was given to Amir Ahmad Shah Durrani by Amir Murad Beg of Bukhara in 1768 in order to solidify a treaty between the two leaders . An alternate account states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloak of Muhammad . He then decided to take the artifact with him to Kandahar , and asked whether he could borrow the cloak from its keepers . They , worrying that he might try to remove it from Bukhara , told him it could not be taken from the city . Ahmad Shah then is said to have pointed to a heavy stela of stone firmly planted in the ground , saying that he would never take the cloak far from the stone . The keepers , gratified at his answer , handed him the cloak . Ahmad Shah then took the cloak , ordered the stone slab to be dug up , and carried them both back with him to Kandahar , where the stone now stands near his ' ' mazar ' ' ( tomb ) . The cloak was last seen in public in 1996 , when Mullah Omar , the up-and-coming leader of the Taliban , removed it from the shrine and donned the cloak while he stood atop a building , and in front of a large crowd of his followers . That symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Taliban , and Mullah Omar himself , associating him with both Ahmed Shah Durrani and the Prophet of Islam . Upon donning the cloak , the crowd began to shout ' ' Amir al-Mu'minin ' ' ( Commander of the Faithful ) , a title that Ayman al-Zawahiri still occasionally uses to refer to Mullah Omar in his radio addresses . Wahid Muzhda , an Afghan analyst and one-time high-ranking official in the Taliban foreign ministry , disputes Mullah Omar donning the cloak . From what I know , from sources close to Omar , and from a chat with the keeper of the shrine where the cloak is kept , Omar did not wear the cloak . Wahid Muzhda 's doubts notwithstanding , in a New York Times piece from winter 2001 , the current keeper of the Shrine , Qari Shawali , claimed that he not only allowed Mullah Omar to view the cloak , but that it was borrowed and removed from the Shrine in the spring of 1996 by Mullah Omar . This was the third time in his lifetime that a man attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
