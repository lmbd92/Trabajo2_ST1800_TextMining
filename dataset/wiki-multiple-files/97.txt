@@176514 ' ' The Beggar 's Opera ' ' is a ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by John Gay with music arranged by Johann Christoph Pepusch . It is one of the watershed plays in Augustan drama and is the only example of the once thriving genre of satirical ballad opera to remain popular today . Ballad operas were satiric musical plays that used some of the conventions of opera , but without recitative . The lyrics of the airs in the piece are set to popular broadsheet ballads , opera arias , church hymns and folk tunes of the time . ' ' The Beggar 's Opera ' ' premiered at the Lincoln 's Inn Fields Theatre on 29 January 1728 and ran for 62 consecutive performances , the longest run in theatre history up to that time ( after 146 performances of Rober Cambert 's Pomone in 1671 ) . The work became Gay 's greatest success and has been played ever since . In 1920 , ' ' The Beggar 's Opera ' ' began an astonishing revival run of 1,463 performances at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the longest runs in history for any piece of musical theatre at that time . The piece satirised Italian opera , which had become popular in London . According to ' ' The New York Times ' ' : Gay wrote the work more as an anti-opera than an opera , one of its attractions to its 18th-century London public being its lampooning of the Italian opera style and the English public 's fascination with it . Instead of the grand music and themes of opera , the work uses familiar tunes and characters that were ordinary people . Some of the songs were by opera composers like Handel , but only the most popular of these were used . The audience could hum along with the music and identify with the characters . The story satirised politics , poverty and injustice , focusing on the theme of corruption at all levels of society . Lavinia Fenton , the first Polly Peachum , became an overnight success . Her pictures were in great demand , verses were written to her and books published about her . After appearing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Beggars Opera ' ' , she ran away with her married lover , Charles Powlett , 3rd Duke of Bolton . Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill adapted the opera into ' ' Die Dreigroschenoper ' ' ( ' ' The Threepenny Opera ' ' ) in 1928 , sticking close to the original plot and characters but with a new libretto and mostly new music . # Origin and analysis # The original idea of the opera came from Jonathan Swift , who wrote to Alexander Pope on 30 August 1716 asking ... what think you , of a Newgate pastoral among the thieves and whores there ? Their friend , Gay , decided that it would be a satire rather than a pastoral opera . For his original production in 1728 , Gay intended all the songs to be sung without any accompaniment , adding to the shocking and gritty atmosphere of his conception . However , a week or so before the opening night , John Rich , the theatre director , insisted on having Johann Christoph Pepusch , a composer associated with his theatre , write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs in the opera , including a fugue based on Lucy 's 3rd act song I 'm Like A Skiff on the Ocean Toss 'd ) and also to arrange the 69 songs . Although there is no external evidence of who the arranger was , inspection of the original 1729 score , formally published by Dover Books , demonstrates that Pepusch was the arranger . The work took satiric aim at the passionate interest of the upper classes in Italian opera , and simultaneously set out to lampoon the notable British Whig Party Gay used Scottish folk melodies mostly taken from the poet Allan Ramsay 's hugely popular collection ' ' The Gentle Shepherd ' ' ( 1725 ) plus two French tunes ( including the carol ' Bergers , Ecoutez La Musique ! ' for his song ' Fill Every Glass ' ) , to serve his hilariously pointed and irreverent texts . The renowned composer , John Christopher Pepusch , composed an Ouverture and arranged all the tunes shortly before the opening night at Lincoln 's Inn Fields on 28 January 1728 . However , all that remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumentation ) and the melodies of the songs with unfigured basses . Various reconstructions have been attempted , and a 1990 reconstruction of the score by American composer Jonathan Dobin has been used in a number of modern productions . Gay uses the operatic norm of three acts ( as opposed to the standard in spoken drama of the time of five acts ) , and tightly controls the dialogue and plot so that there are surprises in each of the forty-five fast-paced scenes and 69 short songs . The success of the opera was accompanied by a public desire for keepsakes and mementos , ranging from images of Polly on fans and clothing , playing cards and fire-screens , broadsides featuring all the characters , and the rapidly published musical score of the opera . The play is sometimes seen to be a reactionary call for libertarian values in response to the growing power of the conservative Whig party . It may also have been influenced by the then-popular ideology of Locke that men should be allowed their natural liberties ; these democratic strains of thought influenced the populist movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Opera ' ' was a part . The character of Macheath has been considered by critics as both a hero and an anti-hero . Harold Gene Moss , arguing that Macheath is a noble character , has written , one whose drives are toward love and the vital passions , Macheath becomes an almost Christ-like victim of the decadence surrounding him . Contrarily , John Richardson in the peer-reviewed journal ' ' Eighteenth-Century Life ' ' has argued that Macheath is powerful as a literary figure precisely because he stands against any interpretation , against expectation and illusion . ' ' The Beggar 's Opera ' ' has had an influence on all later British stage comedies , especially on nineteenth century British comic opera and the modern musical . # Adaptations # As was typical practice of the time in London , a commemorative score of the entire opera was assembled and published quickly . As was common , this consisted of the fully arranged overture followed by the melodies of the 69 songs , supported by only the simplest bass accompaniments . There are no indications of dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three instances : Lucy 's Is Then His Fate Decree 'd Sir one measure of descending scale marked Viol . ; Trape 's In the Days of My Youth , in which the fa la la chorus is written as viol. ; and the final reprieve dance , Macheath 's Thus I Stand Like A Turk , which includes two sections of 16 measures of dance marked viol . ( See the 1729 score , formerly published by Dover ) . The absence of the original performing parts has allowed producers and arrangers free rein . The tradition of personalised arrangements , dating back at least as far as Thomas Arne 's later 18th century arrangements , continues today , running the gamut of musical styles from Romantic to Baroque : Austin , Britten , Sargent , Bonynge , Dobin and other conductors have each imbued the songs with a personal stamp , highlighting different aspects of characterisation .

Its popularity was documented in ' ' The Craftsmen ' ' with the following entries : This Week a Dramatick Entertainment has been exhibited at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields , entitled The Beggar 's Opera , which has met with a general Applause , insomuch that the Waggs say it has made Rich very Gay , and probably will make Gay very Rich . ( 3 February 1728 ) We hear that the British Opera , commonly called The Beggar 's Opera , continues to be acted , at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn Fields with general Applause , to the great Mortification of the Performers and Admirers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 1728 ) Two weeks after opening night , an article appeared in ' ' The Craftsman ' ' , the leading opposition newspaper , ostensibly protesting at Gay 's work as libellous and ironically assisting him in satirising the Walpole establishment by taking the government 's side : : It will , I know , be said , by these libertine Stage-Players , that the Satire is general ; and that it discovers a Consciousness of Guilt for any particular Man to apply it to Himself . But they seem to forget that there are such things as Innuendo 's ( a never-failing Method of explaining Libels ) Nay the very Title of this Piece and the principal Character , which is that of a Highwayman , sufficiently discover the mischievous Design of it ; since by this Character every Body will understand One , who makes it his Business arbitrarily to levy and collect Money on the People for his own Use , and of which he always dreads to give an Account Is not this squinting with a vengeance , and wounding Persons in Authority through the Sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last remark : That the lower People have their Vices in a Degree as well as the Rich , and are punished for them , implying that rich People are not so punished . Criticism of Gay 's opera continued long after its publication . In 1776 , John Hawkins wrote in his History of Music that due to the opera 's popularity , Rapine and violence have been gradually increasing solely because the rising generation of young men desired to imitate the character Macheath . Hawkins blamed Gay for tempting these men with the charms of idleness and criminal pleasure , which Hawkins saw Macheath as representing and glorifying. # Sequel # In 1729 , Gay wrote a sequel , ' ' Polly ' ' , set in the West Indies : Macheath , sentenced to transportation , has escaped and become a pirate , while Mrs Trapes has set up in white-slaving and shanghais Polly to sell her to the wealthy planter Mr Ducat . Polly escapes dressed as a boy , and after many adventures marries the son of a Carib chief .
