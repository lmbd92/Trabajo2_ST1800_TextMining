A bahuvrihi is exocentric , so that the compound is not a hyponym of its head . For instance , a sabretooth ( ' ' smil-odon ' ' ) is neither a sabre nor a tooth , but a feline with saber-like teeth . In Sanskrit bahuvrihis , the last constituent is a noun , more strictly , a nominal stem , while the whole compound is an adjective . In Vedic Sanskrit the accent is regularly on the first member ( tatpurusha ' ' rja-ptra ' ' a king 's son , but bahuvrihi ' ' rj-putra ' ' having kings as sons , viz. ' ' rj-putra- ' ' , m. , father of kings , ' ' rj-putr- ' ' , f. , mother of kings ) , with the exception of a number of non-nominal prefixes such as the privative a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise an exception to this rule . In English bahuvrihis , the last constituent is usually a noun , while the whole compound is a noun or an adjective . Accent is on the first constituent . English bahuvrihis often describe people using synecdoche : ' ' flatfoot ' ' , ' ' half-wit ' ' , ' ' highbrow ' ' , ' ' lowlife ' ' , ' ' redhead ' ' , ' ' tenderfoot ' ' , ' ' longlegs ' ' , and ' ' white-collar ' ' . # Examples # * Houndstooth , a woven fabric with a patterns resembling dog 's teeth : She 's wearing houndstooth. * Old money , members from established upper-class who have usually inherited their wealth : He 's definitely old money . * Bluestocking , an educated , intellectual or artistically accomplished woman : Auntie Maud will never marry ; she 's a bluestocking .
