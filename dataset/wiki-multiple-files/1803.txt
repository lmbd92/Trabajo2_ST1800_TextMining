The band was beginning to gain prominence on MySpace , becoming the number-one unsigned act on the site . The song Apologize was already released on MySpace the same year . When a remixed version of Apologize found its way onto Timbaland 's Shock Value in early 2007 , and after the song 's appearance in a number of American TV dramas , allied with two years of MySpace notoriety , OneRepublic were faced with a number one hit , even without an accompanying album . # Composition # Many critics cited U2 , Coldplay , Snow Patrol and The Fray as the band 's influences on the album . The album starts out with Say ( All I Need ) , which according to Blogcritics is a U2-sounding song , that is full of soaring heartfelt vocals . It begins with a vocal effect , and leads to an overlooking verse on a girl 's soul by Ryan Tedder . With chopped-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with rising crescendos and interesting musical textures . Mercy features an upbeat tempo and is full of hope and promise . Stop and Stare is a big , muscular rock ballad , which according to Digital Spy is very much in the Matchbox 20 mould , steered by a vein-poppingly emotional vocal from lead singer Ryan Tedder . Apologize has heart-felt lyrics and is heavy on self-imposed melodrama . It has hip-hop beats mingling with a string section cutting Ryan Tedder 's bland vocals with a stuttering R&amp;B drum loop . Goodbye Apathy has a chorus that was considered charmingly harmonious , while Tedder 's vocals were considered U2-sounding . All Fall Down begins with an acoustic riff followed by strings that follow the riff , while the verses follows the instruments as well .

Prodigal is a pure ballad that uses guitar riffs and keyboards to back dreamy vocals . Wont Stop is almost an alternative country in its sound . It is a ballad compared to Turin Brakes classic The Optimist LP , replete with strings , bells , and harmonized vocals . All We Are is a ballad backed by keyboards and reminiscent of The Fray in both sound and style . Someone To Save You was considered a big song , with big vocals and big sound , kind of a ballad on steroids . The sombre piano ballad Come Home offers a political stance on the war and an appeal to bring the troops home . It is a tribute to American soldiers and was written by Tedder about a soldier friend of his who was serving overseas . The last track is a remixed version of Apologize produced and featuring Timbaland . The Timbaland remix has his trademark yeah grunts in the background and a slight resequencing of the drum patterns . # Critical reception # ' ' Dreaming Out Loud ' ' received generally mixed reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album 3 out of 5 stars , and noted that the album still sounded derivative , almost as if it were mimicking the popular trends that Tedder helped create with his production gigs .

Evan Sawdey from PopMatters wrote : Though Greg Wells ' high-budget production gives ' ' Dreaming Out Loud ' ' a professional sheen , the problems start and end with Tedder . His band , his voice , his lyricsthey 've all been heard before . What 's particularly disappointing is how his songs all just blend together in a strictly melodic sense . Rob Sheffield from ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' commented : On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a drag , since the half-loud guitars and sob-in-the-throat vocals could be absolutely anybody . Nick Levine from Digital Spy called it a fairly drab , characterless affair . Chris Jones from BBC Music expressed : It remains an album that will appeal to fans of the OC and those moments when the lovelorn antics of the cast demand some cod-existentialism . It may be pop , but it 's a long way from fun . # Singles # The first single to be lifted from the album was Apologize , both in its original form and a version remixed by Timbaland .
