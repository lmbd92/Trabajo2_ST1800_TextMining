@@456514 Joe Melson ( born May 1935 ) is an American singer and a BMI Awardwinning songwriter. # Life and career # Melson was born in Bonham , Fannin County , Texas . He was reared on a farm until he was sixteen . He attended high school in Gore , Oklahoma , and in Chicago , Illinois , before he returned to Texas to study at the two-year Odessa College in Odessa , the seat of Ector County . He studied and played music as a teenager and fronted a rockabilly band called the Cavaliers . Beginning in 1957 , first at his home in Midland , Texas , and then in Nashville , Tennessee , Melson teamed up with a virtual unknown Roy Orbison , with whom he would write a string of hits for Monument Records . Prior to their collaboration , Orbison had been solely a rockabilly performer . Although Melson himself was rooted in that music genre , he had begun writing rhythm and blues songs . Melson recognized the potential in Orbison 's voice , encouraging the singer to explore its power through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on March 25 , 1960 , was the first operatic rock ballad in the history of popular music . The song went to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States and to #1 in the UK Singles Chart , which launched Orbison to international musical stardom . Not only did that song influence Orbison to write such operatic ballads as In Dreams , but a few months later it also induced Orbison 's friend Elvis Presley to record It 's Now or Never , based on the Neapolitan art song ' O Sole Mio . Melson and Orbison followed up with similar sounds such as the dramatic Running Scared that went to #1 in the US . The result of their collaborative efforts produced such songs as : * Uptown ( 1960 ) * Only the Lonely ( 1960 ) * Blue Angel ( 1960 ) * I 'm Hurtin ' ( 1961 ) * Running Scared ( 1961 ) * Crying ( 1961 ) * The Crowd ( 1962 ) * The Actress ( 1962 ) * Gigolette ( 1962 ) * Blue Bayou ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1964 ) * Lana in 1964 * Cry Softly Lonely One ( 1967 ) * Harlem Woman ( 1972 ) Lana was originally written for Virgil Johnson 's The Velvets , based in Odessa . Orbison also later recorded th song . Between 1960 and 1963 , Melson recorded several singles of his own ( the best known being Hey Mister Cupid ) for Hickory Records and also through Acuff-Rose Music wrote songs for some of that label 's other artists including Dan Folger . He then recorded a few songs for the EMP Records label in 1964 and 1965 that achieved limited success . His last hit collaboration with Orbison came in 1963 with the writing of Blue Bayou , although some of their cooperative efforts would be recorded in later years . The two got together again between 1971 and 1975 , but while the venture did not yield the commercial success their collaboration once had , it brought such memorable songs as Harlem Woman . Over the years , Melson continued to perform at rockabilly and nostalgia festivals , and in 2002 he was inducted into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
