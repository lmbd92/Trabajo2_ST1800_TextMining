It was one of the first live rock music bootlegs and was made notorious as a document of their 1969 tour of the United States . The popularity of the bootleg forced the Stones ' label Decca Records to release the live album ' ' Get Yer Ya-Yas Out ! The Rolling Stones in Concert ' ' in 1970 . ' ' Live'r ' ' is also one of the earliest commercial bootleg recordings in rock history , released in December 1969 , just two months after the Beatles ' ' ' Kum Back ' ' and five months after Bob Dylan 's ' ' Great White Wonder ' ' . Like the two earlier records , ' ' Live'r s outer sleeve is plain white , with its name stamped on in black ink . # Recording and release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was recorded by Dub Taylor from Trademark of Quality using a Sennheiser shotgun microphone and a Uher Report 4000 reel-to-reel tape recorder . It was the first audience-recorded rock bootleg to be mastered and distributed ; some sources consider it the first live bootleg . Though the sound is not nearly as clear as the official release of ' ' Get Yer Ya-Ya 's Out ! ' ' , the recording is considered to be very strong for an audience recording , especially one of that era . The Rolling Stones performed two sets that night and it is the second concert that was more heavily bootlegged and has sharper sound . Bootleggers had collaborated to record Stones shows across the United States , recording them on two-track Sony recorders for months prior to the release of the album . At least one source claims that the recordings initially came from rock promoter Bill Graham 's staff , who used the tapes for broadcast on KSAN and released their edit on Lurch Records in early 1970 . The recording was made available about one month after the concert , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released ' ' Ya-Ya 's ' ' as a response to the bootleg and the quality was high enough that it was rumoured that the band had even released the bootleg themselves . The recording has been released through several bootleg labels , including the original release by Trademark of Quality ( catalogue number 71002 ) , Swingin ' Pig , and Sister Morphine , usually documenting only the second set . The Swingin ' Pig release even replace performances of Jumpin ' Jack Flash and Under My Thumb with different recordings from the band 's 10 November performance in San Diego and their two-night stint in New York City and attempted to enhance the sound quality by using de-clicking technologyboth changes have drawn criticism in comparison to the original TMOQ release . # Reception and influence # ' ' Live'r Than You 'll Ever Be ' ' was reviewed by Greil Marcus in the 7 February 1970 , issue of ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' . In his review , Marcus praises the sound of the album and speculates that it may have been recorded from the stage ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film ' ' Gim me Shelter ' ' . The album also received praise as a more authentic example of the Stones on stage because ' ' Get Yer Ya-Ya 's Out ! ' ' was heavily overdubbed in many places . Richie Unterberger has noted that the recording is inferior to the sound quality of ' ' Ya-Ya 's ' ' , but displays a spontaneity that the official recording lacks and this helps to explain its long-lasting appeal to fans . Reviewing the album in 1970 , Wim Wenders called it the best Rolling Stones record . The album would eventually sell enough copies to qualify for a gold record RIAA certification , with TMOQ sources claiming that it had sold 250,000 copies by November 1970150,000 of which were produced by other bootleggers . Although the album did not chart on the ' ' Billboard ' ' 200 , the magazine did include it in a list of best-selling bootlegs in 1971 , noting that hard sales figures were impossible to confirm , but six-figure sales had been routinely discussed .
