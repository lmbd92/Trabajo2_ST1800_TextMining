@@340514 Infobox aircraft begin Infobox aircraft type The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 is a family of twin-engine , short- to medium-range , single-aisle commercial jet airliners . The MD-80 series were lengthened and updated from the DC-9 . The airliner family can seat from 130 up to 172 passengers depending on variant and seating configuration . The MD-80 series was introduced into commercial service on October 10 , 1980 by Swissair . The series includes the MD-81 , MD-82 , MD-83 , MD-87 , and MD-88 . These all have the same fuselage length except the shortened MD-87 . The MD-80 series was followed into service in modified form by the MD-90 in 1995 and the MD-95/Boeing 717 in 1999. # Design and development # # Background # Douglas Aircraft developed the DC-9 in the 1960s as a short-range companion to their larger DC-8 . The DC-9 was an all-new design , using two rear fuselage-mounted turbofan engines , and a T-tail . The DC-9 has a narrow-body fuselage design with five-abreast seating , and holds 80 to 135 passengers depending on seating arrangement and aircraft version . The MD-80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was originally called the DC-9-80 series and the DC-9 Super 80 and entered service in 1980 . The MD-80 series was then developed into the MD-90 entering service in 1995 . The last variant of the family was the MD-95 , which was renamed the Boeing 717-200 after McDonnell Douglas 's merger with Boeing in 1997 . The DC-9 family is one of the most successful jet airliners with a total of over 2,400 units produced ; it ranks third behind the second place Airbus A320 family with over 4,000 produced , and the first place Boeing 737 with over 7,000 produced . # MD-80 series # The ' ' MD-80 series ' ' is a mid-size , medium-range airliner that was introduced in 1980 . The design was the second generation of the DC-9 with two rear fuselage-mounted turbofan engines , small , highly efficient wings , and a T-tail . The aircraft has distinctive five-abreast seating in coach class . It was a lengthened DC-9-50 with a higher maximum take-off weight ( MTOW ) and a higher fuel capacity . The aircraft series was designed for frequent , short-haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seating arrangement . The development of MD-80 series began in the 1970s as a growth version of the DC-9 Series 50 . Availability of new Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D higher-bypass engines drove early studies including designs known as Series 55 , Series 50 ( re-fanned Super Stretch ) , and Series 60 . The design effort focused on the Series 55 in August 1977 . With the projected entry into service in 1980 , the design was marketed as the ' ' DC-9 Series 80 ' ' . Swissair launched the Series 80 in October 1977 with an order for 15 plus an option for five . The Series 80 featured a fuselage 14ft3in m longer than the DC-9-50 . The DC-9 wings were redesigned by adding sections at the wing root and tip for a 28% larger wing . The initial Series 80 first flew October 19 , 1979 . It entered service in 1980 . Originally it was certified as a version of the DC-9 , but was changed to MD-80 in July 1983 , as a marketing move . New versions of the series were initially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certification was DC-9-81/82 etc . Only the MD-88 was given an MD certification , as was the later MD-90 . The MD-80 versions have cockpit , avionics and aerodynamic upgrades along with the more powerful , more efficient and quieter JT8D-200 series engines , which are a significant upgrade over the smaller JT8D-15 , -17 , -11 , and -9 series . The MD-80 series aircraft also have longer fuselages than their earlier ' ' DC-9 ' ' counterparts , as well as longer range . Some customers , such as American Airlines , still refer to the planes in fleet documentation as Super 80 . This model is still flown extensively by American Airlines and Delta Air Lines . Comparable airliners to the MD-80 series include the Boeing 737-400 and Airbus A320 . In 2012 a freighter version has been created by converting surplus passenger planes . # Flight testing and certification # The first MD-80 , DC-9 line number 909 , made its first flight on October 19 , 1979 . Test flying , despite two aircraft substantially damaged in accidents , was completed on August 25 , 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MD-81 ( or DC-9-81 ) , was certificated under an amendment to the FAA Type Certificate for the DC-9 . The flight-testing leading up to certification had involved three aircraft accumulating a total of 1085 flying hours on 795 flights . The first delivery , to launch customer Swissair took place on September 13 , 1980. # Model designation # As the MD-80 was not in effect a new aircraft , it continues to be operated under an amendment to the original DC-9 FAA aircraft Type Certificate ( a similar case to the later MD-90 and Boeing 717 aircraft ) . The Type Certificate issued to the aircraft manufacturer carries the aircraft model designations exactly as it appears on the manufacturer 's application , including use of hyphens or decimal points , and should match what is stamped on the aircraft 's data or nameplate . What the manufacturer chooses to call an aircraft for marketing or promotional purposes is irrelevant to the airworthiness authorities . The first amendment to the DC-9 type certificate for the new MD-80 aircraft was applied as DC-9-81 , which approved on August 26 , 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments to the DC-9 Type Certificate . In 1983 , McDonnell Douglas decided that the DC-9-80 ( Super 80 ) would be designated the MD-80 . Instead of merely using the MD- prefix as a marketing symbol , an application was made to again amend the Type Certificate to include the MD-81 , MD-82 , and MD-83 . This change was dated March 10 , 1986 , and the Type Certificate declared that although the MD designator could be used in parentheses , it must be accompanied by the official designation , for example : DC-9-81 ( MD-81 ) . All Long Beach aircraft in the MD-80 series thereafter had MD-81 , MD-82 , or MD-83 stamped on the aircraft nameplate . Although not certified until October 21 , 1987 , McDonnell Douglas had already applied for models DC-9-87 and DC-9-87F on February 14 , 1985 . Third derivative was similarly officially designated DC-9-87 ( MD-87 ) , although no nameplates were stamped DC-9-87 . For the MD-88 , an application for a Type Certificate model amendment was made after the earlier changes , so there never was a DC-9-88 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1987 . The FAA 's online aircraft registry database shows the DC-9-88 and DC-9-80 designations in existence but unused . # Production # The MD-80 was produced on a common line with the DC-9 with which it shares its line number sequence . After the delivery of 976 DC-9s and 108 MD-80s , McDonnell Douglas stopped DC-9 production . Hence , commencing with the 1,085th DC-9/MD-80 delivery , an MD-82 for VIASA in December 1982 , all DC-9s produced were Series 80s/MD-80s . In addition to the Long Beach , California line , a second assembly line was set up at Shanghai , where aircraft were to be built under license . During 1991 , MD-80 production had reached a peak of 12 per month , having been running at approximately 10 per month since 1987 and was expected to continue at this rate in the near term ( 140 MD-80s were delivered in 1991 ) . As a result of the decline in the air traffic and a slow market response to the MD-90 , MD-80 production was reduced , and 84 aircraft were handed over in 1992 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 ( 3.5 per month ) and 22 aircraft were handed over . MD-80 production ended in 1999. # Derivative designs # The MD-90 was developed from the MD-80 series and is a 5ftm adj=mid , updated version of the MD-88 with a similar electronic flight instrument system ( EFIS ) ( glass cockpit ) , and improved , and quieter IAE V2500 turbofan engines . The MD-90 program began in 1989 , first flown in 1993 , and entered commercial service in 1995 . A number of other variants were proposed that never entered production . One proposal was the MD-94X , which was fitted with unducted fan turbofan engines . Previously , an MD-81 was used as a testbed for unducted fan engines , such as the General Electric GE36 and the Pratt &amp; Whitney/Allison 578-DX . The MD-95 was developed to replace early DC-9 models , then approaching 30 years old . The project completely overhauled the original DC-9 into a modern airliner . It is slightly longer than the DC-9-30 and is powered by new Rolls-Royce BR715 engines . The MD-95 was renamed Boeing 717 after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MD-80 series has been used by airlines around the world . Major customers have included Aerolneas Argentinas , Aeromxico , Aeropostal Aerorepublica , Alaska Airlines , Alitalia , Allegiant Air , American Airlines , Aserca , Austral Lneas Areas , Austrian Airlines , Avianca , China Eastern Airlines , China Northern Airlines , Delta Air Lines , Finnair , Iberia , Japan Air System ( JAS ) , Korean Air , Lion Air , Martinair Holland , Pacific Southwest Airlines ( PSA ) , Reno Air , Scandinavian Airlines System ( SAS ) , Spanair , Insel Air , Swissair , and Trans World Airlines . Due to the usage of the aging JT8D engine , the MD-80 is not fuel efficient compared to the A320 or newer 737 models ; it burns 1050USgal l of jet fuel per hour on a typical flight , while the larger Boeing 737-800 burns only 850USgal l per hour ( 19% reduction ) . Starting in the 2000s , many airlines began to retire the type . Alaska Airlines ' tipping point in using the 737-800 was the $4 per gallon price of jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the airline stated that a typical Los Angeles-Seattle flight would cost $2,000 less , using a Boeing 737-800 , than the same flight using an MD-80 . American Airlines has announced plans to retire at least 20 MD-80s , and has accelerated delivery of new 737-800s , while Midwest Airlines announced on July 14 , 2008 , that it would retire all 12 of its MD-80s ( used primarily on routes to the west coast ) by the fall . The JT8D 's comparatively lower maintenance costs due to simpler design help narrow the fuel cost gap . # Variants # # MD-81 # The MD-81 ( or as it was originally known the DC-9 Super 81 or DC-9-81 ) was the first production model of the MD-80 , and apart from the MD-87 , the differences between the various long body MD-80 variants is relatively minor . The four long body models ( MD-81 , MD-82 , MD-83 , and MD-88 ) only differ from each other in having different engine variants , fuel capacities , and weights . The MD-88 and later build versions of the other models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimensions : The basic long body MD-80 versions ( MD-81 , MD-82 , MD-83 , and MD-88 ) have an overall length of 147ft10 in , and a fuselage length of 136ft5 in that is 4.62 m longer than the DC-9-50 and 13.51 m longer than the initial DC-9 , the Series 10 . Wingspan was also increased by 4.4 m in comparison with earlier DC-9s at 107ft10.2 in . The aircraft 's passenger cabin , from cockpit door to aft bulkhead , is 101ft0 in long and , as with all versions of the DC-9 , has a maximum cabin width ( trim-to-trim ) of 123.7 in . Powerplant : The initial production version of the MD-80 was the Pratt and Whitney JT8D-209 18500lbf kN thrust powered MD-81 . Later build MD-81s have been delivered with more powerful JT8D-217 and -219 engines . APU : All versions of the MD-80 are equipped with an AlliedSignal ( Garrett ) GTCP85-98D APU as standard , which is located in the aft fuselage . Performance : Standard MTOW on the MD-81 is 140000lb kg with the option to increase to 142000lb kg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 155 passengers , is 1,565 nmi . Flight Deck : The MD-80 is equipped with a two crew flightdeck similar to that on the DC-9 from which it evolved . Later models could be equipped to a higher specification with EFIS displays in place of the traditional analogue instruments , TCAS , windshear detection , etc . An EFIS retrofit to non-EFIS equipped aircraft is possible . Cabin : Typical passenger cabin seating arrangements include : : A mixed-class , with aft full-service galley , configuration for a total of 135 passengers with 12 first class , four-abreast 36-inch seat pitch . : 123 economy-class passengers , five-abreast , 32 in pitch . : All-economy layout for 155 passengers , five-abreast , 32- and 33-inch pitch . : A typical high-density layout is for 167 one class ( i.e. , Airtours ) . Undercarriage : All versions of the MD-80 are equipped with a tricycle undercarriage , featuring a twin nose unit with spray deflector and twin main units with rock deflectors . The MD-80T , developed for the Chinese , differs in that the main units are each fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading . Aerodynamic Improvements : From mid-1987 , new MD-87-style low-drag beaver tail cones were introduced on all Series of MD-80s , reducing drag and hence improving fuel burn . It would seem that some operators have been modifying the old DC-9-style cones on earlier-build MD-80s to the new low-drag style . SAS is one airline that has done this , citing both the improved economics as well as cosmetic improvement for the modification . # #MD-81 timeline# # * Formal launch : October 1977. * First flight : October 18 , 1979. * FAA certification : August 25 , 1980. * First delivery : September 13 , 1980 to Swissair * Entry into service : October 10 , 1980 with Swissair on a flight from Zurich to Heathrow . * Last delivery : June 24 , 1994 to JAL Domestic # MD-82 # Announced on April 16 , 1979 , the MD-82 ( DC-9-82 ) was a new MD-80 variant with similar dimensions to those of the MD-81 but equipped with more powerful engines .

American Airlines is the world 's largest operator of the MD-82 , with at one point over 300 MD-82s in the fleet . Originally certificated with 20000lbf kN thrust JT8D-217s , a -217A-powered MD-82 was certificated in mid-1982 and became available that year . The new version featured a higher MTOW ( 149500lb kg ) , while the JT8D-217As had a guaranteed take-off thrust at temperature of up to 29 degrees C or 5000ft m altitude . The JT8D-217C engines were also offered on the MD-82 , giving improved sfc . Several operators took delivery of the -219-powered MD-82s , while Balair ordered its MD-82s powered by the lower-thrust -209 engine . The MD-82 features an increased standard MTOW initially to 147000lb kg , and this was later increased to 149500lb kg . Standard fuel capacity is the same as that of the MD-81 , 5840USgal l , and typical range with 155 passengers is 2050 nmi. # #MD-82 timeline# # * Announced/go-ahead : April 16 , 1979. * First flight : January 8 , 1981. * FAA certification : July 29 , 1981. * First delivery : August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service : August , 1981 with Republic Airlines . * Last delivery : November 17 , 1997 to U-Land Airlines of Taiwan . The MD-82 was assembled under license in Shanghai by the Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corporation ( SAIC ) since November 1986 ; the sub-assemblies were delivered by McDonnell Douglas in kit form . China had begun a pure cargo version design , designated as Y-13 , but the project was subsequently cancelled with the conclusion of the license assembly of MD-82/90 in China . # MD-83 # The MD-83 ( DC-9-83 ) is a longer range version of the basic MD-81/82 with higher weights , more powerful engines , and increased fuel capacity . Powerplant : Compared to earlier models , the MD-83 is equipped with slightly more powerful 21000lbf kN thrust Pratt and Whitney JT8D-219s as standard . Performance : The MD-83 features increased fuel capacity as standard ( to 6970USgal l ) , which is carried in two 565USgal l auxiliary tanks located fore and aft of the centre section . The aircraft also has higher operating weights , with MTOW increased to 160000lb kg and MLW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 155 passengers is around 2504 nmi . To cope with the higher operating weights , the MD-83 incorporates strengthened landing gear including new wheels , tires , and brakes , changes to the wing skins , front spar web and elevator spar cap , and strengthened floor beams and panels to carry the auxiliary fuel tanks . From MD-80 line number 1194 , an MD-81 delivered in September 1985 , it is understood that all MD-80s have the same basic wing structure and in theory could be converted to MD-83 standard . # #MD-83 timeline# # * Announced/go-ahead : January 31 , 1983. * First flight : December 17 , 1984. * FAA certification : October 17 , 1985 ( MTOW 149500lb kg ) .

Dimensions : With an overall length of 130ft5 in , the MD-87 is 17ft4 in shorter than the other MD-80s but is otherwise generally similar to them , employing the same engines , systems and flight deck . The MD-87 features modifications to its tail , with a fin extension above the tailplane . It also introduced a new low drag beaver tail cone , which became standard on all MD-80s . Powerplant : The MD-87 was offered with either the 20000lbf kN thrust JT8D-217C or the 21000lbf kN thrust -219 .

The MD-88 is , depending on specification , basically similar to the MD-82 or MD-83 except that it incorporates an EFIS cockpit instead of the more traditional analog flight deck of the other MD-80s . Other changes incorporated into the MD-88 include a wind shear warning system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes are relatively minor and were written back as standard on the MD-82/83 . The wind shear warning system was offered as a standard option on all other MD-80s and has been made available for retrofitting on earlier aircraft including the DC-9 . Delta 's earlier delivered MD-82s were upgraded to MD-88 specification . When McDonnell Douglas was asked why these aircraft were MD-88s and not MD-82s they said that the customer , Delta Air Lines , thought that its specification was sufficiently different to warrant a new designation . Although delivered in December 1987 , Delta put the aircraft into service only in January 1988 . Performance : The MD-88 has the same weights , range , and airfield performance as the other long-body aircraft ( MD-82 and MD-83 ) and is powered by the same engines . MDC quotes a typical range for the MD-88 as 2050 nmi with 155 passengers . Range with 155 passenger is increased to 2504 nmi with two additional auxiliary fuel tanks ( similar to the MD-83 ) . # #MD-88 timeline# # * Announced/go-ahead : January 23 , 1986. * First flight : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1987. * First delivery : December 19 , 1987 to Delta Air Lines . * Entry into service : January 5 , 1988 with Delta Air Lines . * Last delivery : June 25 , 1997 to Onur Air . # Undeveloped variants # # #MD-80 Advanced# # McDonnell Douglas revealed at the end of 1990 that it would be developing an MD-80 improvement package with the intent to offer beginning in early 1991 for delivery from mid-1993 . The aircraft became known as the ' ' MD-80 Advanced ' ' . The main improvement was the installation of Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-290 engines with a 1.5 in larger diameter fan and would , it was hoped , allow a 6 dB reduction in exterior noise . Due to lack of market interest , McDonnell Douglas dropped its plans to offer the MD-80 Advanced during 1991 . Then in 1993 , a mark 2 MD-80 Advanced version reappeared with the modified JT8D-290 engines as previously proposed . The company also evaluated the addition of winglets on the MD-80 . In late 1993 , Pratt &amp; Whitney launched a modified version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being offered for the DC-9X re-engining program , and was also evaluating the possibility of developing a new JT8D for possible retrofit on the MD-80 . The engine would also be available on new build MD-80s . The 18000lbf kN to 19000lbf kN thrust -218B engine version shares a 98% commonality with the existing engine , with changes designed to reduce NOx , improve durability , and reduce noise levels by 3 dB . The 218B could be certificated in early to mid-1996 . The new engine , dubbed the 8000 , was to feature a new fan of increased diameter ( by 1.7 in ) , extended exhaust cone , a larger LP compressor , a new annular burner , and a new LP turbine and mixer . The initial thrust rating would be around 21700lbf kN thrust . A launch decision on the new engine was expected by mid-1994 , but never occurred . The MD-80 Advanced was also to offer a new flight deck instrumentation package and a completely new passenger compartment design . These changes would be available by retrofit to existing MD-80s , and was forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to incorporate the advanced flight deck of the MD-88 , including a choice of reference systems , with an inertial reference system as standard fitting and optional attitude-heading equipment . It was to be equipped with an electronic flight instrument system ( EFIS ) , an optional second flight management system ( FMS ) , light emitting diode ( LED ) dot matrix electronic engine and system displays . A Honeywell windshear computer and provision for an optional traffic-alert and collision avoidance system ( TCAS ) were also to be included . A new interior would have a 12% increase in overhead baggage space and stowage compartment lights that come on when the door opens , as well as new video system featuring drop-down LCD monitors above . The lack of market interest for the MD-80 Advanced during 1991 led McDonnell Douglas to drop its plans for the development . # Derivatives # The MD-90-30 is a stretched variant with updated glass cockpit and two V2500 engines , also Extended Range ( ER ) version as the MD-90-30ER .
