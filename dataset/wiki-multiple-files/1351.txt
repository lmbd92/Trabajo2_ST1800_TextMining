@@8195514 A square-up was a common feature of exploitation films in the 1940s and 1950s . With the exception of most burlesque features during the 1950s , the films would begin with a written message about what social or moral issue the film was planning to address . For instance , ' ' She Shoulda Said No ! ' ' contained a square-up concerning youth drug abuse , and ' ' Child Bride ' ' the issue of child marriage . The first square-up has been traced to Eureka Productions 's 1912 film ' ' The Evil Art ( or ) Gambling Exposed ' ' . The general reasoning for the square-up was an expression of regret for presenting the subject of the film followed by a statement with the desire that the film will help in efforts to combat the subject . Often , these justifications were created with the intent to work around the production code , giving the films educational or social value as opposed to being simply exploitation features , but also served the purpose of warming up the audience for the upcoming film contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David F. Friedman has explained that , in some cities , the police would not allow a full screening of a film with nudity or other objectionable content . Following the announcement to the now-upset crowd , the edited film was shown , and , after the film was over , a second reel with the excised material was shown . Coming from the carnival term squaring a beef , these square-up reels became typical . In some cases , such as ' ' The Girls of Loma-Loma ' ' , the entire film became a short square-up reel .
