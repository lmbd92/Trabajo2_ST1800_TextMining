It connects with the Metro Rail and Metrolink commuter rail systems . The line is operated by Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority . Since the line runs on streets in the Downtown Los Angeles area , the line is subject to detours . Usage has grown steadily since the service was introduced in December 13 , 2009 with weekday ridership reaching 13,765 in Oct 2012 . The El Monte Station was doubled in size between 2010 and 2012 to handle a total of 40,000 passengers a day and a joint fare program was introduced with the Silver Streak ( bus ) operated by Foothill Transit . The service runs every 48 minutes during the peak hour period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes on Saturdays and 30 minutes on Sundays/Holidays . Service during the night on Weekdays is every 3040 minutes . Service during the night on Saturdays , Sundays/Holidays is 60 minutes between 8:00 p.m. -9:00 p.m. , and then 40 minutes until the remainder of the night . The Silver Line 's route on the I-110 and I-10 freeways was converted to high occupancy toll ( HOT ) lanes with many other changes as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project which were complete by February 2013 . There are still a few transit improvements currently being worked on the Silver Line stations . # Description # The bus rapid transit line runs west from the El Monte Station in El Monte to Union Station using high-occupancy/toll lanes ( HOT lanes ) on the El Monte Busway . From there it heads south along surface streets through downtown Los Angeles , joins the Harbor Transitway using HOV lanes for the final section to the Harbor Gateway Transit Center in the district of Harbor Gateway near the city of Carson . It also serves California State University , Los Angeles , the County+USC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bus stops in the downtown area with connections to Metro Rail services and mainline rail services from Union Station . The line also serves stations in the communities of Exposition Park , South Los Angeles and Gardena . The Metro Silver Line serves a combination of stations and street stops . The Silver Line will have a new busway station near the Patsaouras Transit Plaza in June 2015 as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project . While none of the Silver Line stations are presently equipped with ticket vending machines , during a Metro Board of Directors meeting in January 2013 , the implementation of 5 ticket vending machines at the El Monte Station was approved . During August 2012 , Metro added a Metro pylon sign for the Silver Line at Harbor Gateway Transit Center , as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project . Metro has recently approved proposals to revitalize the Silver Line stations and improve wayfinding as well as adding art to their stations . Metro is expected to upgrade all of the Silver Line stations by December 2014. # Hours of operation # : Weekdays : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes off-peak , 30-40 minutes during late night : Saturdays : Every 20 minutes during the day , 60 minutes between 8:00p.m. -9:00p.m. , 40 minutes during late night : Sundays/Holidays : Every 20 minutes during the day , 60 minutes between 8:00p.m. -9:00p.m. , 40 minutes during late night First and last service to El Monte Station : ' ' Northbound to Downtown Los Angeles and Eastbound to El Monte Station ' ' : *First Bus to El Monte On Mondays-Fridays : 4:49 am : *First Bus to El Monte On Saturdays , Sundays/Holidays : 4:59 am : *Last Bus to El Monte On Mondays-Thursdays , Sundays/Holidays:12:56 am : *Last Bus to El Monte on Fridays &amp; Saturdays Nights : 2:00 am First and last service to Harbor Gateway Transit Center : ' ' Westbound to Downtown Los Angeles and Southbound to Harbor Gateway Transit Center ' ' : *First Bus to Harbor Gateway Transit Center on On Mondays-Fridays : 3:30 am : *First Bus to Harbor Gateway Transit Center on Weekends and Holidays : 4:58 am : *Last Bus to Harbor Gateway Transit Center On Mondays-Thursdays , Sundays/Holidays : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Fridays &amp; Saturdays Nights : 2:00 am # Fares # A flat premium fare of $2.45 or two fare zones is charged ( which is a different fare structure from other Metro routes ) . Metro Day Pass holders may use the service without paying any additional charges , which is a mitigation to passengers who now have to transfer to the Silver Line . Metro Silver Line riders can now use their Metro day pass , 7-day pass , or 30-day pass on the Silver Streak for a boarding between Downtown Los Angeles and El Monte Station . Likewise , Silver Streak riders can now use their Foothill 31-day passes on the Metro Silver Line between Downtown Los Angeles and El Monte Station . The program allows Metro Silver Line riders and Foothill Transit 's Silver Streak riders to ride the Silver Streak bus or the Metro Silver Line with either the Foothill Transit 31-Day Pass or the Metro 30-Day , 7-Day or Day Pass between the Silver 2 Silver bus corridor . The program only applies between Downtown Los Angeles and El Monte Station , although Foothill Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metro Silver Line all the way from El Monte Station to Harbor Gateway Transit Center . Metro provides a subsidy to Foothill Transit to make up the 30-cent difference using funds from the Metro Express Lanes toll charge . The program will be reviewed in October 2013 and will be made permanent if it is deemed to be a success . The following table shows the Metro Silver Line fares as of July 25 , 2011 ( in US dollars ) . Since the Metro Silver Line runs almost entirely on the freeway , its fare is higher than the Metro Rail Lines , Metro **27;1860;TOOLONG Lines and Metro Orange Line . All payments are made on board the Metro Silver line bus . At the moment , there are no ticket vending machines for the Metro Silver Line , but Metro expects to begin installing them soon . As part of the Silver 2 Silver bus program , Foothill Transit passengers can ride the Metro Silver Line using their Foothill Silver Streak 31-day pass only between the Silver corridor which is between El Monte Station and Downtown Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one year implementation . align= center class= wikitable ! Fare Type ! Regular ! Senior <BR/> /Disabled <BR/> /Medicare # Ridership and reliability # Weekday ridership has risen from about 7,000 passengers when the service started in December 2009 to 7,741 in September 2010 ( partly due to passengers switched from the Foothill Transit Silver Streak ) , 10,414 and September 2011 and 13,765 by October 2012 . A ridership report of the line on May 2013 indicated average weekday ridership was roughly 12,799 , average Saturday boardings was 5,553 and average Sunday and holiday boardings was 3,708 . The on-time performance of the Metro Silver Line is currently around 77.8% . On time performance increased to 80% since the opening of the Metro Express Project is complete . With less cars on the hov lanes , the buses operate at faster speeds and less traffic on the lanes . # History # Opening of the route , originally scheduled for June 2009 , was delayed until December 2009 due to issues with funding and fare structure on other express lines using the transitways . Before the Metro Silver Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the El Monte Busway and the Harbor Transitway charged an express fare up to $3.95 ( included local portion of route plus freeway portion ) . If a passenger wanted to commute on both busways : El Monte Busway and the Harbor Transitway , the passenger would pay an express fare of $3.95 for each busway , totaling to $7.90 . The proposal base fare for the Metro Silver Line was $1.50 , as is available on the Metro Orange Line and Metro Blue Line . Objections were raised by Foothill Transit that the low fare would undermine their Silver Streak service which also runs on the El Monte Busway . A fare of $2.45 for the entire route , regardless of the length , was agreed upon . Ridership has grown steadily on the Harbor Transitway portion and many passengers have become accustomed to the fare structure . The Metro Silver Line was the only line in the Metro Rail/Liner system that did not have an opening ceremony with free rides offered to the public . This is one reason why the line is not well known by passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reference to the Metro Silver Line . The line gets its color from the El Monte Busway route color . The Bronze Line name and color were also considered , but was removed from consideration for potential use with a future rail line . Metro Silver Line route connects all Metro Rail lines , including the Gold and Red/Purple Lines at Union Station , Red/Purple and Blue/Expo Lines at 7th/Metro and the Green Line at Harbor Freeway Station . The new line replaced Metro Express lines 444 , 446 , 447 , 484 , and 490 which previously ran on the Harbor Transitway and El Monte Busway . These lines were rerouted and re-numbered to provide connecting service to the Silver Line as follows : *Line 444 was replaced by 344 , which provided limited-stop service between the Harbor Gateway Transit Center ( formerly the Artesia Transit Center ) and Palos Verdes Peninsula . *Lines 446/447 were replaced by 246/247 which provided local service between the Harbor Gateway Transit Center and San Pedro ( Line 247 was later restructured as Lines 205 and 450 in June 2011 ) . *Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poly Pomona and El Monte Station via Valley Boulevard . *Line 490 became the 190 , providing local service between Cal Poly Pomona and El Monte Station via Ramona Boulevard . *Other routes on the transitways remained in operation . Service frequency on the Harbor Transitway section was increased to every 15 minutes during the midday period and every 40 minutes on Saturday in December 2011 . As part of the Metro ExpressLanes project a number of changes were made between 2010 October 2012 . Funding for increased service has come from federal funds and congestion pricing charges . *Additional weekday peak services were introduced in June 2012 and Sunday/holiday services were doubled to every 30 minutes . *In June 2012 Saturday service frequency was increased to 20 minutes and to 30 minutes on Sundays . *In August 2012 an additional evening service was added due to construction of the Metro Express Lanes project on the I-10 freeway . Service between the hours of 8:21 am 12:57 am now runs every 30 minutes . *The Harbor Gateway Transit Center ( formerly the Artesia Transit Center ) was provided with CCTV security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were provided with enhanced signage , lighting and security at Park &amp; Ride lots . *In August 2011 Eastbound local eastbound bus stops were created at the Slauson &amp; Manchester stations under the transitway ( prior to this passengers using the Metro Local Line 108 and Metro Limited Line 358 eastbound were required to walk one block to the stations ) . There is still no westbound stop . A new Silver 2 Silver fare structure was introduced in October 2012 . Prior to its introduction , the fare for the Silver Streak was $2.75 and $2.45 for the Metro Silver Line . As a result , many passengers opted to use the Metro Silver Line as opposed to the Silver Streak . Silver Line buses would often be at capacity during peak hours , even while running a 4-8 minute headway , with Silver Streak buses being under-utilized . Metro was initially looking at the possibility of adding additional service , but wanted to better use the El Monte Busway in conjunction with Foothill Transit . In addition , both services use the same fare pass , the TAP card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line as part of the June 23 , 2013 bus service changes . The first change was a new street stop was added for northbound buses at Figueroa Street/23rd Street to provide better connectivity to the 23rd Street Metro Expo Line Station . The street stop is also served by Metro Local line : 81 . The other minor change was a new southbound bus trip going from El Monte Station to Downtown Los Angeles and south to Harbor Gateway Transit Center in the early morning . The first trip departing El Monte Station to Downtown Los Angeles and then to Harbor Gateway Transit Center departs at 3:31 A.M. The new trip was added due to the demand for earlier morning service from El Monte Station to Downtown Los Angeles . On December 15 , 2013 Metro Silver Line 's southbound route became modified between Downtown Los Angeles and 23rd Street Metro Expo Line Station . The Silver Line now runs south on Flower St between 12th Street and 23rd Street . Northbound route and stops remain unchanged . Metro Silver Line stops at Figueroa/Pico , Figueroa/Washington and 23rd Street/Flower St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new stops are Flower/ Pico , Flower/Washington and Flower/23rd Street . The motive behind this change is due to the constant closure of Figueroa Street near the Convention Center and LA Live . Silver Line trips would often become delayed in this area due to congestive traffic . In addition , Metro Silver Line 's Sunday/Holiday service frequencies became enhanced to operate every 20 minutes on Sundays/Holidays . This matches the line 's Saturday service frequencies . Funding for more Silver Line service came from funds from the Metro Express Lanes . # Current developments # # Metro ExpressLanes project # The El Monte Busway and Freeway transitways are being converted to high occupancy toll ( HOT ) lanes as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project . The Harbor Freeway sectionbegan operation as a HOT lane on November 14 , 2012 and the El Monte busway portion began February 23 , 2013 . It will be retained if it proves to be successful in improving traffic speeds on the transitways . Work to create the high occupancy toll lanes on the Harbor Transitway took place between August 2011 and September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted Bus priority to traffic lights in Downtown Los Angeles as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project which was expected to improve service performance in Downtown Los Angeles . This work was completed by October 31 , 2012 . CCTV cameras were installed at the Harbor Transitway Stations . They were installed at the parking lots during the month of September 2012 . Digital message signs are currently being tested for operation . The digital message signs would tell passengers at what time will the Silver Line bus pass and also Metro Express Lines . The CCTVs and the digital message signs were placed into service on October 31 , 2012 . Installation of bike lockers were installed at Harbor Gateway Transit Center during July 2010 . The new El Monte Station opened to the public on October 14 , 2012. # New transitway station at Patsaouras Transit Plaza # A new transitway station for the Metro Silver Line will be located at Patsaouras Transit Plaza at Union Station to provide better access to bus , MetroRail , Metrolink and Amtrak services which is expected to be complete by July 2015. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , adjacent to the El Monte Station terminus . When the Metro Silver Line began operation on December 13 , 2009 , the line was also operated by Division 18 . In June 2010 , operation of the line was turned over completely to Division 9. # Incidents # Vehicle strike at the Harbor Freeway Station On February 22 , 2012 seven passengers waiting on the northbound platform of the Harbor Freeway Station received critical and serious injuries when a private vehicle entered the station and struck the platform . Metro 's safety committee reviewed station safety at the request of Metro 's CEO , Art Leahy and published their report in April 2012 . Bollards were added at the platform edge of a number of stations during August 2012. # Stations &amp; Street Stops # One different feature between the Metro Orange Line and the Metro Silver Line is the station features . While the Metro Orange Line operates on a dedicated busway with only busway stations and no street stops , the Metro Silver Line operates a combination of street stops and busway stations . The Downtown Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detours which means the street stops may or may not be served by the Metro Silver Line during detour times . # Fleet # Metro Silver Line received 27 CNG ( Compressed Natural Gas ) powered 45ft m buses which were built by North American Bus Industries at the companys facility in Anniston , Alabama . The buses were received to Metro in May 2009 . These buses were painted in a silver paint . Nearly all of the buses were first used for the Metro Local Line : 902 , which was supposed to relive ridership of the Metro Orange Line . Metro Local Line 902 was canceled in late 2011 due to its poor ridership and excessive duplication with the Metro Orange Line . These buses were provided when Line 902 in the San Fernando Valley was cancelled . When Metro Local Line 902 was canceled , all 27 NABI buses were moved to Metro 's San Gabriel Valley bus division 9 in El Monte . In June 2011 , most of the buses were wrapped to brand the Metro Silver Line . Though the Silver Line is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have the Metro Liner name and dark gray livery . As of December 2011 , all 27 45 feet Compost NABI buses are painted in Metro Silver scheme . The buses say A faster way to Downtown : Metro Silver Line . The service is operated with 45ft m buses in a silver scheme branding the Metro Silver Line . The line is internally known as Line 910 or Dual Hub BRT . Currently . there are 35 buses painted in the Metro Silver Line fleet . They include buses #83608391 , 8405 and 85128514 . Originally the Metro Silver Line began service with 27 buses painted the metro local scheme . In December 2011 , all 27 buses were painted in a silver sleek color branding the Silver Line . In mid-2012 , Metro Silver Line received #83888391 and #8405 in the metro local scheme . Bus #8405 was originally in the West Valley division , but it was then transferred to division 9 for the Silver Line . In September 2012 , all 5 of these buses were painted in the Silver Line livery . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , 3 additional buses ( #85128514 ) , painted in the metro local livery were transferred to division 9 . As of January 2013 , these three buses are still not painted in the Metro Silver Line livery . During weekday rush hours , some metro local buses are operated on the Metro Silver Line . Metro is currently looking at the possibility of adding more new buses for the Metro Silver Line . # Photo Gallery # <gallery> File:Slauson Silver Line Station 10. jpgA Metro Silver Line bus at Slauson Silver Line Station on November 9 , 2011 .
