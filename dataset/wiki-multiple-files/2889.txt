@@25519514 The Rimutaka Incline railway accident occurred on 11 September 1880 when the leading three carriages on a Greytown to Wellington train were blown off the track in strong winds near the Siberia tunnel ; killing three passengers . The Rimutaka Incline section of the line over the Rimutaka Ranges between Wellington and the Wairarapa used the Fell system on the steep 1 in 15 section which was 4.8km mi long . A small train left Greytown at 8.30am bound for Wellington . At Cross Creek , at the foot of the Rimutaka Ranges , a Fell Engine ( H class ) was added to the train to push it up the steep 1 in 15 ascent to the summit of the Rimutaka Incline . At Cross Creek the two passenger cars and the luggage carriage were put in front of the engine . Then behind this were two wagons of timber and lastly the Fell brake van . All went well until the train reached an area of the incline known as Siberia . A strong north-west wind was blowing across the track . A terrific gust hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway line . The body of the first carriage was torn from its mountings and the passengers were thrown on to the hillside , although the couplings held . The weight of the engine prevented the carriages from falling into the valley below , and the grip of the engine on the raised centre-rail saved the whole train from destruction and more loss of life . The engine and brake van also had brakes which gripped the raised centre rail . The rear brakesman uncoupled his van and piloted the van down the incline to Cross Creek to get help . Three children were killed instantly and there were many injuries , some horrific . One of the injured , Stanley George Nicholas aged 5 years , died later from injuries received . The inquest found that the deaths were accidental , caused by the carriages being blown off the line , and no blame was attached to anyone . Action was urged to erect windshelters on dangerous parts of the incline , and this was done . When the wind was fierce , two engines were used on the incline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railcar ( R.M.6. ) travelling south on the Wairarapa line was blown off the track by a gust estimated at 128 km/h ( 80 mph ) . Eight passengers , seven of whom were women , were injured . The accident happened between Featherston and Pigeon Bush , just before a large wooden breakwind. # See also # * List of wind-related railway accidents # References # * Conly , Geoff &amp; Stewart , Graham ' ' Tragedy on the Track : Tangiwai &amp; other New Zealand Railway Accidents ' ' pp 6872 ( Grantham House Publishing , Wellington , 1986 ) ISBN 9781869340087 pp 73-77 -- *
