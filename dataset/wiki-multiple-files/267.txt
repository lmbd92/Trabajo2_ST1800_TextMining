After defeating the Turks , and Napoleons defeat in Russia Turks agreed to the terms of the agreement from 1815 .

Following one such rebellion , he agreed to adopt a constitution in 1835 . The move was opposed by neighboring Austria , the ruling Ottoman Empire and Russia . It is believed that the three great empires saw the constitution as a danger to their own autocratic systems of government . Metternich 's Austria particularly ridiculed the fact that Serbia had its own flag and ministry of foreign affairs . Milo abolished the constitution at the demand of Russia and Turkey . Milo abdicated in 1839 in favor of his sons Milan , who died a few weeks later , and Mihailo , who then became prince . Mihailo was deposed in 1842 , and the family was out of power until 1858 , when it returned with Milo restored as prince for the last two years of his life .
