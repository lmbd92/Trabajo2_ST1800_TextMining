It is an analysis of the interchange between soccer and the new global economy .

Soccer is here the globalized medium that seems to lend itself to explaining the effects globalization has on society as a whole . # Themes # # Failure of globalization # In the first part of the book , Foer tries to explain the failure of globalization to erode ancient hatreds in the games great rivalries , commonly referred to as football hooliganism .

( the Old Firm ) in Scotland and the tendency of supporters of Tottenham Hotspur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminology ( such as yid ) , causing some opposing supporters to employ antisemtic chants and taunts. # Rise of corporate hegemons # In the second part of the text , the author uses soccer to address economics : the consequences of migration , the persistence of corruption , and the rise of powerful new oligarchs like Silvio Berlusconi , the President of both Italy and the AC Milan club . # Persistence of nationalism and tribalism # In the final part , Foer uses soccer to defend the virtues of old-fashioned nationalism , as a way to blunt the return of tribalism . The book thus challenges theories that a universal , globalist philosophy will subsume local nationalisms . Overarching structures such as the European Union and the United Nations may attain structural prominence , but underneath the veneer of these structures , vibrant sub-cultures and tribal loyalties remain , and may even be strengthened by modern communications like the Internet . They may thus foreshadow not the hope for unity sought by globalized bureaucratic and political elites and corporate oligarchs , but increasing fragmentation and national/ethnic conflict within outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received positive reviews in ' ' The New York Times ' ' and ' ' The Washington Post ' ' .
