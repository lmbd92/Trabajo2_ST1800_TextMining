@@4292514 In science fiction , the term quantum singularity is used to refer to many different phenomena , which often approximately resemble a gravitational singularity in the scientific sense in that they are massive , localized distortions of space and time . The name invokes one of the most fundamental problems remaining in modern physics : the difficulty in merging Einstein 's Theory of Relativity ( which includes singularities within its models of black holes ) and quantum mechanics . In fact , since singularities are infinitely small according to relativity , they are expected to be quantum mechanical by their nature ; a theory of quantum gravity would be required to describe this behavior , and no such theory has yet been completed . On the other hand , only one kind of singularity has ever been observed ( black holes ) , and due to the mass dependent , stable radius of the connected event horizon , it is currently unknown if this kind of singularity actually approaches or even drops below scales relevant to quantum mechanics . # In Star Trek # A quantum singularity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Star Trek : Voyager episode Parallax . The singularity creates a mirror image and a temporal distortion . Voyager flies into the singularity after seeing an image of itself inside . To escape , the crew uses a shuttle and fires a tachyon beam at an opening created upon entry . In Voyager episode Hunters the Voyager crew discover a Hirogen relay station almost 100,000 years old that is powered by a quantum singularity . The word tiny is used to apparently describe the dimensions of the quantum singularity . Specifically , it is stated to be about a centimeter in diameter , making it , in fact , ironically and paradoxically enormous , although it is possible that the diameter stated could refer instead to the singularity 's event horizon . In episode Scorpion Species 8472 and the Borg make use of quantum singularities to travel to and from fluidic space . Artificial quantum singularities are also used to power Romulan Warbirds as first described in the Star Trek : The Next Generation episode Timescape . Additionally , in the Star Trek : Deep Space Nine episode Visionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shift through time . # In Futurama # In the episode of Futurama , Love and Rocket , the term Quantum Singularity is used after Bender breaks-up with the Planet Express ship , whom he only dated during this episode . The ship takes the break-up pretty hard and then threatens to fly into a giant quasar , thus the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity . Bender gets the crew out of the situation by professing his love for the ship , albeit sarcastically , which distracts it long enough for Fry and Leela to disable the ship 's logical processes and restore life support systems . # In Megas XLR # In the episode Battle Royale , the villain Magnanimous threatens to drop Kiva and Jamie into a quantum singularity , which he says is like a black hole , only portable , and with a cooler name . # In Farscape # In the episode Back and Back and Back to the Future , a scientist belonging to the Ilanic race develops a Quantum Singularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was described essentially as a portable black hole . # In Stargate SG-1 # Supergate A gigantic Stargate designed to allow the passage of starships . The Supergate is made up of 90 smaller pieces that are moved through a regular Stargate . Once assembled , a nearby planet is collapsed into a quantum singularity , using a special force field , in order to provide the massive power needed to open a wormhole to the Ori galaxy . Samantha Carter theorizes that the singularity allows a connection to be maintained indefinitely . The first Ori attempt to create a Supergate in the Milky Way fails when Vala Mal Doran inserts her Tel'tak into the incomplete ring and prevents the segments from completely connecting . The shockwave from the forming singularity then blasts the gate to oblivion . A second Supergate is later built successfully and allows a fleet of Ori motherships into the Milky Way . The SGC eventually blocks the Supergate to the Ori by opening a connection from a Pegasus gate powered by a natural black hole . # In City of Heroes # In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet power a gravity controller attains at level 32 . The Singularity takes the form of a human sized ball of light surrounded by waves of coloured energy . The Singularity is portable , and will follow its summoner around . The Singularity uses a variety of gravity based attacks . # References
