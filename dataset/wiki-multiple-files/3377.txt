@@31027514 One of the key advertising campaigns of The Villages is that residents are able to play free golf for life . The advertising is only partially true ; the free golf is paid for by mandatory amenities fees assessed to all homeowners in The Villages . The free golf extends only to the executive golf courses and only to players walking the courses , wherein a greens fee is not assessed . Players riding golf carts on executive courses pay no greens fee but must pay a trail fee . Greens fees and trail fees are required on The Villages country club courses ( though memberships are provided free &amp;ndash ; again , as part of the amenities fee &amp;ndash ; to residents ) . # Executive Courses # All of The Villages ' executive courses are 9-hole layouts .
