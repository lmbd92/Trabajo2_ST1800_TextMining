It is located on Barry Island , Marguerite Bay , Antarctic Peninsula . At the time of its foundation in 1951 , it was the first human settlement south of the Antarctic Circle . south of the Equator it is Argentina 's westernmost permanent base . San Martn is one of 13 research bases in Antarctica operated by Argentina . # History # The increased Antarctic activity that Argentina developed since 1940 , along with the longstanding national interest to exercise effective sovereignty over one of the most remote areas of Antarctica created the need for a scientific station located south of the Antarctic Circle . In order to transport the personnel and materials to Marguerite Bay , where the new settlement was to be built , the Argentine Navy hired the ' ' Santa Micaela ' ' . Commanded by Overseas Captain Santiago Farrell , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prez Companc S. A .. The ' ' Santa Micaela ' ' left the port of Buenos Aires on 12 February 1951 , and on 8 March it anchored at Marguerite Bay . The last part of the trip it was escorted by the Argentine Navy tug ARA ' ' Sanavirn ' ' . Over twelve working days the crew built the two-story main house with double wooden walls , a main deposit , an emergency house , five metal warehouses for supplies , housing for the dog packs , a power generator and the four towers for the 25 m high rhombic antenna . San Martn was inaugurated on 21 March 1951 , in the presence of the ' ' Santa Micaela ' ' and ARA ' ' Sanavirn ' ' crews and the base personnel leaded by then Colonel Hernn Pujato . Since then , the meteorological station within the base provides detailed weather records and develops forecasts indispensable for the navigation of the sea waters adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula .

On 30 June 1952 a fire , exacerbated by the ongoing blizzard , devoured the main house and two food stores , the power plant and the radio station . With rationed food and fuel , activities continued normally , carrying on with the explorations schedule as originally planned . During the 195253 season , thick ice blocked the way of relief ships , which aggravated the situation for the twenty base inhabitants . On 26 March 1953 the Argentine Air Force Avro Lincoln nicknamed ' ' Cruz del Sur ' ' airdropped food and other priceless items . Personnel at San Martn Base conducted several exploration expeditions to the northern and southern boundaries of the bay . They also crossed the Antarctic Peninsula mountain range , reaching the Mobiloil Inlet on the Weddell Sea . In 1960 the base was closed ; it was reactivated as permanent on 21 March 1976 . On 14 June 1962 an expedition led by then First Lieutenant Gustavo Adolfo Gir Tapper left Esperanza looking for a passage that would link the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they explored Duse Bay , Prince Gustav Channel , Cape Longing , Foca Nunataks , Ameghino Peninsula , Jason Island , Cape Robinson and Carreta Bay , where they had to leave the snow cats and continue with sleds to cross the cordillera . After reaching San Martn , they traveled back to Esperanza , where they arrived on 25 August . During the trip the party overcame numerous obstacles and withstood temperatures below -43 C and katabatic winds of 220 km/h . This feat is considered even now as the most important ever made in the area . # Historic site # Some unused installations of the base , a cross , a flagpole and a monolith erected in 1951 , have been designated as Historic Site or Monument , following a proposal by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting . # Description # Marguerite Bay opens on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula . Wide and deep , the bay is closed between Belgrano and Alexander I islands , and the Fallieres Coast , making its access very difficult for most of the year due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the difficulties and hazards for navigation , there are several groups of islands , islets , rocks and reefs that draw a network of channels and fjords , usually frozen . Some of the most important islands are the Pourquoi Pas , Herradura , Caballete and Millerand , all of them next to the Debenham archipelago , where San Martn was built . San Martn is composed of 14 buildings spanning a total area of 18ha m2 sqft . The base has several dependencies and facilities , namely : main house ; airstrip ; heliport ; infirmary ; chapel ; main and auxiliary power plants ; vehicle fleet ( a number of ski-doos , and a few snow tracks and ATVs ) and park , laboratory , mechanical and carpentry workshops , and several deposits . The all-year capable airstrip is located on nearby Uspallata Glacier ; during winter the deeply frozen sea is also used to land light aircraft . The 20 m2 infirmary and basic operating suite is attended by a doctor and a nurse ; it has one bed , x-ray and odontological facilities .

An ongoing bilateral agreement between Argentina and Germany has prompted cooperation on glacier movement observations . # Climate # The most significant feature in the area 's climate is the violent wind , with speeds well in excess of 200 km/h , which significantly increases the chill factor ; such strong winds often blow for five or six days in a row , making it impossible to stay outdoors and turning any simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is variable : on average it reaches -37 C in winter and 8 C in summer .
