@@13877514 Prostitution in Spain is not addressed by any specific law , but a number of activities related to it such as pimping are illegal . # Legal status # Prostitution ( ' ' Prostitucin ' ' ) was decriminalised in 1995 . Prostitution itself is not directly addressed in the Criminal Code of Spain , but exploitation such as pimping is illegal . The only article in the Code dealing specifically with adult prostitution is Artcle 188 , which bans pimping : # ' ' 1 . El que determine , empleando violencia , intimidacin o engao , o abusando de una situacin de superioridad o de necesidad o vulnerabilidad de la vctima , a persona mayor de edad a ejercer la prostitucin o a mantenerse en ella , ser castigado con las penas de prisin de dos a cuatro aos y multa de 12 a 24 meses . En la misma pena incurrir el que se lucre explotando la prostitucin de otra persona , aun con el consentimiento de la misma ' . # Owning an establishment where prostitution takes place is in itself legal , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ' ' hire ' ' a person to sell sex because prostitution is not considered a job and thus has no legal recognition . # Local government # Local governments differ in their approaches to both indoor and outdoor prostitution , usually in response to community pressure groups , and based on ' public safety ' . Most places do not regulate prostitution , but the government of Catalonia offers licenses for persons to gather people to practice prostitution . These licenses are used by brothel owners to open ' clubs ' , where prostitution takes place ( the women are theoretically only ' gathered ' to work on the premises not employed by the owner ) . Some places have implemented fines for street prostitution . # Politics # # History # Prostitution was tolerated in Spain throughout the mediaeval period , until the 17th century and the reign of Phillip IV ( 162165 ) whose 1623 decree closed the ' ' mancebas ' ' ( brothels ) forcing the women out into the street , a very unpopular decision , but one that remained in place till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18431868 ) regulation was introduced , firstly in cities , the ' ' Disposiciones de Zaragoza ' ' ( 1845 ) and the ' ' Reglamento para la represin de los excesos de la prostitucin en Madrid ' ' ( 1847 ) , followed by the 1848 Penal Code . ( Guerena 2003 , 2008 ) In 1935 during the Second Republic ( 1931-6 ) prostitution was prohibited . Once the Dictatorship ( 193975 ) was established , this law was repealed ( 1941 ) . Spain became officially ' ' abolitionist ' ' on 18 June 1962 , when the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others1949 United Nations ( UN ) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others was ratified by Spain , and the Decree 168 of 24 January 1963 modified the Penal Code ( ' ' Cdigo Penal ' ' ) according to the Convention . In theory , this policy , in accordance with the Convention , regarded sex workers ( ' ' trabajadores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated punishment of their exploiters rather than the workers themselves , and refused to distinguish between voluntary and coerced sex work . However , there were inconsistencies , as the prostitutes were in fact treated more like criminals : under Act 16/1970 of 4 August on social menace and rehabilitation ( ' ' Ley de peligrosidad y rehabilitacin social ' ' ) prostitutes were declared amongst those classes categorized as social evils , and could be confined to special centres or forbidden to live in specified areas . In practice however , prostitution was quietly ignored and tolerated . Although democracy was restored in 1975 , it was not till the Penal Code revisions of 1995 that this policy was revisited , and most laws regarding prostitution were repealed , with the exception of those governing minors and those with mental health problems . This included the Act 16/1970 . Further revisions in 1999 addressed trafficking , as did the 2000 Immigration Act which followed other European precedents by offering asylum to trafficked victims if they collaborated ( Valiente 2003 ) . In 2012 , at Santa Cruz de Tenerife 91% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opinion remains deeply divided in Spain over prostitution , and law reform has been in a political impasse for a long time . Consequently it remains in rather a grey zone of unregulated but tolerated semi-legality . The standard debates exist as to whether it is work like any other work , or exploitation of women as espoused by groups like ' ' Malostratos ' ' . Meanwhile it thrives , and has prompted headlines such as ' ' El nuevo burdel de Europa ' ' ( The New Brothel of Europe ) . # Public policy # The key instruments in order of importance are the Penal Code ( Cdigo penal ) ( 1822- ) and the Immigration or Aliens Act ( Ley de Extranjera de Espaa ) 2000 . Plans : *Plan Municipal de Intervencin ante la Prostitucin en el municipio 2011-2014 , Santa Cruz de Tenerife # Migrant workers # According to a 2009 TAMPEP study , 90% of sex workers are migrants . Of all countries studied , only Italy had such a high percentage of migrant workers . About 80% of these were Latin American ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see also Laura Oso , 2003 , 2010 ) , however this is changing rapidly due to arrival of Central European migrants ( mainly Romania and Bulgaria ) who now make up 25% compared to 50% from Latin America . There is also considerable cross-border traffic between Spain and Portugal and France . Equally , some 80% of Spanish national workers have worked outside Spain , mainly from economic necessity . This needs to be appreciated in the overall context of Immigration to Spain . As in other countries in Western Europe , there is concern over the presence of migrant workers on the streets and claims that many of them were coerced . In 2008 the Spanish Government announced plans to aid women who had been trafficked . Organisations working with migrant women , include Proyecto Esperanza and shelters such as IPSSE ( Instituto para la Promocin de Servicios Especializados ) In 2012 to September 2013 , was identificated 544 prostitutes in 138 inspections in burdels of Asian prostitutes in Barcelona The 30 November of 2012 , arrest in Cuenca a woman from Paraguay , 34 years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age # Advocacy # Organisations working with sex workers in Spain include APRAMP ( Associacion para la Prevencin , Reinsercin y Atencin de la Mujer Prostituida ) while sex workers ' rights organisations include Hetaira ( Madrid ) , as well as regional organisations such as SICAR Asturias , AMTTTSE ( Asociacin de Mujeres , Transexuales y Travestis como Trabajadoras Sexuales en Espaa , Mlaga ) and CATS ( Comit de Apoyo a las Trabajadoras del Sexo , Murcia ) . Spanish sex workers continue to be concerned about their lack of protection and in July 2011 petitioned the Minister of Health ( Leire Pajn ) . A demonstration is planned for November 6 , 2011 in Madrid , and a communique has been released setting out sex workers ' complaints and demands . # Social history # Prostitution in Spain was highly sectored , with at one end the ' ' damas cortesanas ' ' of high society , and the mistresses of the bourgeoisie and ' ' barraganas ' ' , the concubines of the clergy .

Best known though are his controversial Majas . Other examples are Murillo 's ' ' Four Figures on a Step ' ' and Picasso 's ' ' Les Demoiselles d'Avignon ' ' ( illustrated ) . In literature , Cervantes discusses prostitution in Don Quixote , and the subject is found throughout 19th and 20th century Spanish literature . # Sex work celebrities in Spain # La seora Rius ( see photograph ) is a Barcelona celebrity and Madam who told her story in Julin Peir 's ' ' La Sra .
