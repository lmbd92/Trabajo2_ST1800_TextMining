@@78514 In Greek mythology , the Meliae ( ; ' ' Meliai ' ' or ' ' Meliades ' ' ) were nymphs of the ash tree , whose name they shared . They appeared from the drops of blood spilled when Cronus castrated Uranus , according to Hesiod , ' ' Theogony ' ' 187 . From the same blood sprang the Erinyes , suggesting perhaps that the ash-tree nymphs represented the Fates in milder guise ( Graves 6.4 ) , and the Giants . From the Meliae sprang the race of mankind of the Age of Bronze . # Description # The Meliae belong to a class of sisterhoods whose nature is to appear collectively and who are invoked in the plural , though genealogical myths , especially in Hesiod , give them individual names , such as Melia , but these are quite clearly secondary and carry no great weight ( Burkert 1985 III.3.2 ) . The Melia thus singled out is one of these daughters of Oceanus . By her brother the river-god Inachus , she became the mother of Io , Phoroneus , Aegialeus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was the mother of Amycus by Poseidon , as the Olympian representative of Oceanus . Many species of ' ' Fraxinus ' ' , the ash trees , exude a sugary substance , which the ancient Greeks called ' ' mli ' ' , honey . The species of ash in the mountains of Greece is the Manna-ash ( ' ' Fraxinus ornus ' ' ) . The Meliae were nurses of the infant Zeus in the Cretan cave of Dikte , according to Callimachus , ' ' Hymn to Zeus ' ' . They fed him honey . Of manna , the ash-tree sugar , the standard 19th-century US pharmacopeia , ' ' The Dispensatory of the United States of America ' ' ( 14th edition , Philadelphia , 1878 ) said : Fermented honey preceded wine as an entheogen in the Aegean world . # Meliae # The Meliai were perhaps the same as the honey-nymph ( meliai ) nurses of the god Zeus , Ida and Adrasteia . The manna meli of the ash and the honey of bees were thought to be related and being regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' ' Theogony ' ' they were born aside the Erinyes , avengers of the castration of Uranus , and the Gigantes . In Hesiod appear to be the Kouretes-protectors of the baby Zeus . As children born of the castration , it would be proper that they are brothers should play a role in the downfall of Cronus , performer of the crime . They were an overly aggressive race who incurred the wrath of Zeus and were ruined in the flood of the Great Deluge . # Argive genealogy in Greek mythology #
