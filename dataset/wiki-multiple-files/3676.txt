@@34538514 The Willem River or Willems River was named during the voyage of the Dutch East India Company ( Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie , or VOC ) ship ' ' Mauritius ' ' in 1618 , under the command of Supercargo Willem Janszoon and captained by Lenaert Jacobszoon , and is one of the few features named on a nautical chart made in 1627 . From that information Willems River would almost certainly have been named after Supercargo , Willem Janszoon , the Commander of the ship ' ' Mauritius ' ' . Janszoon was captain of the Duyfken in 1605-1606 , when part of the Gulf of Carpentaria was mapped , during the earliest documented visit to Australia by a vessel from the Netherlands . ' ' Caert va n't Landt van d'Eendracht ' ' ( Chart of the Land of Eendracht ) is a 1627 chart made by Hessel Gerritsz and is one of the earliest charts showing the coastline of Western Australia . The Willems River is located to the extreme left ( north ) end of the coastline on the chart and a closer view is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is believed that the Willems River of 1618 is the Ashburton River ( Western Australia ) . cite journal The chart shows ' ' Willems revier , besocht by ' t volck van ' t Schip Mauritius in Iulius A 1618 ' ' ( Willem 's River , visited by the crew of the ship ' ' Mauritius ' ' in July 1618 ) . The detail of the rivers position on the chart , backs up the claim that this is the Ashburton River , which , being at 21 degrees 40 minutes south and 114 degrees 56 east , is almost exactly the latitude shown on the chart . The chart is oriented with north to the left , showing lines of latitude from 20th parallel south to the 35th parallel south at the base of the map . The lines of latitude appear to be very accurate , matching closely known features through the length of the chart . Other factors to back up that this is the Ashburton river is that it takes almost a 90 degree turn north-east , once in the mouth , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river mouth in reality is of the same shape as shown on the chart . # 1627 chart accuracy # A note on the chart 's accuracy is given by the author Heeres in 1899 , from the following excerpt . # The 1627 chart is specially interesting . Gerritsz. , at the time cartographer in ordinary to the E.I.C. , has put together this chart of the Landt van d'Eendracht from the journals and drawings of the Steersmen , which means that he availed himself of authentic data *** . He acquitted himself of the task to admiration , and has given a very lucid survey of the ( accidental ) discoveries made by the Dutch on the west-coast of Australia . In this chart of 1627 the Land of d'Eendracht takes up a good deal of space . To the north it is found bounded by the Willemsrivier , discovered in July 1618 by the ship Mauritius , commanded by Willem Janszoon **** . According to the chart this river is in about 21 45 ' S. Lat. , but there are no reliable data concerning this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not use all the data then available . Thus , for instance , he left unused those furnished by the Zeewolf ( No . VIII , pp. 10 ff . below ) , and those of the ship Leiden ( No . XV , p. 49 ) . <br/> <br/> **** See the Documents under No IX ( pp. 12f . ) . # What Heeres means by the sentence , ' ' According to the chart this river is in about 21 45 ' S. Lat. , but there are no reliable data concerning this point , ' ' is that in 1899 they had no reliable information about exactly what was at that latitude . # ' ' Mauritius ' ' at North West Cape # On 31 July 1618 , the ' ' Mauritius ' ' reached North West Cape ( west of Exmouth Gulf ) , where crew members went ashore and saw footprints ; this was the closest that Europeans had yet come to making contact with indigenous Australians in Western Australia . Janszoon and Jacobszoon assumed that the cape was an island : the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that it was named Cloates Island in 1720 and this misconception lingered until the 19th century . As the Willems River was also named in July it would appear that the ' ' Mauritius ' ' , which reached Bantam ( city ) The 1627 chart was based on a number of voyages , beginning with the 1616 voyage of Dirk Hartog . On that voyage Hartog named Eendrachtsland after his ship , the ' ' Eendracht ' ' meaning Unity . Eendrachtsland is one of the earliest names given to the Australian mainland . # Notes #
