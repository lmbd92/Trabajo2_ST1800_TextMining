@@11982514 The Barlow Endowment for Music Composition is a scholarship established in September 1983 through the generosity of Milton A. and Gloria Barlow . Motivated by their love of music , the Barlows presented a substantial gift to Brigham Young University , engendering and supporting excellence in musical composition through the university and the BYU College of Fine Arts and Communications . The Barlow Endowment Board of Directors and Board of Advisors have subsequently been engaged in employing the proceeds of the Endowment to support four programs : The Barlow Prize , General Commissions , LDS Composer Commissions , and Education Grants . Every year , the Endowment hosts an international composition competition . Applications from across the globe are accepted and reviewed by a panel of musicians . The winners are selected and commissioned to compose new works during the next year . # Barlow prize # Each year , the Barlow Endowment selects a genre for the Barlow Prize .
