@@5106514 ' ' Twilight Imperium ' ' is a strategy board game produced by Fantasy Flight Games . It was designed by Christian T. Petersen and was first released in 1998 . The game is currently in its third edition , released in 2005 . The third edition currently has two expansions - ' ' Shattered Empire ' ' was released on December 12 , 2006 , and ' ' Shards of the Throne ' ' was released on May 27 , 2011 . The information in this article focuses primarily on the third edition ( as the prior editions have significant gameplay differences ) . # Game Background # Thousands of years ago the galaxy was ruled by the Lazax from their centrally-located capital of Mecatol Rex . After centuries of decline their empire fell and the Lazax were seemingly exterminated by their enemies . The Winnarian custodians of Mecatol Rex maintain the imperial libraries and oversee the meetings of the galactic council until the day that a new emperor arises to unite the galaxy under a single race 's rule once again . # Components # The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each showing up to three planets , empty space , or a red-bordered system containing an obstacle to starship movement ( asteroid field , nebula , supernova , Ion Storm , or Gravity Rift ; the last two were added in the expansions ) . The standard gameboard setup contains 37 tiles in three concentric hex-rings around the center tile , Mecatol Rex . Plastic playing pieces are provided in six colors , with various starship classes and ground forces . The players are limited to the number of playing pieces provided with the game , except for fighters and ground forces . Numerous counters are included for use in record-keeping , including command tokens , strategy cards , control markers , trade goods , and extra fighter and ground force counters . The counters are printed on heavy cardboard stock . Several decks of cards are used to track planets , trade agreements , and technologies controlled by a player , perform special actions , provide randomized goals for victory points , and set the political agenda for a turn . These cards are about half the size of standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Races # # Overview # The game also includes a race reference card for each of the ten alien species described in the game which includes all the relevant game information on one side and a brief history of the race on the other . Up to six ( or eight , with the ' Shattered Empires ' expansion ) of these races will appear in a game , depending on the number of players . Each race has unique special abilities , homeworld(s) , and starts with different units and technology . All the Races have distinct characters and themes . The Hacan are wealthy lion-like traders , while the Sardakk N'orr are insect-like warriors . Other unique races include the Jol-Nar , the technological masters of the galaxy ; the Xxcha Kingdom , politically powerful diplomats ; the Yssaril , chameleon-like spies ; The Embers of Muaat , beings of living fire ; and the Mentak Coalition , space pirates . # List of races # # #Base Game ( 3rd edition ) races# # *The Emirates of Hacan *The Universities of Jol-Nar *The Barony of Letnev *The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L1Z1X Mindnet *The Mentak Coalition *The Naalu Collective *The Yssaril Tribes # # ' ' Shattered Empire ' ' expansion pack races# # *The Embers of Muaat *The Clan of Saar *The Winnu *The Yin Brotherhood # # ' ' Shards of the Throne ' ' expansion pack races# # *The Arborec *The Ghosts of Creuss *The Nekro Virus *The Lazax ( only used in Lazax Scenario ) # Gameplay # Three to six ( eight , with ' Shattered Empires ' ) players can play . Each player randomly selects a race to control . The players are each dealt a number of system tiles which they place one at a time to construct the galaxy map , with Mecatol Rex at the center . The players ' home systems are placed around the periphery of the map . A first player is chosen randomly . That player is given the speaker token and is allowed to choose a strategy card for the turn first . In future turns the first choice of strategy card is given to the player who chose the Initiative strategy card in the last round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strategy card for the current turn ( two cards if there are 3 or 4 players ) . The strategy card chosen determines the order in which the players will act during the current turn , provides a primary ability that the holder of the strategy card will use during the turn , and a secondary ability that the other players may use when the primary ability is activated . There are eight strategies - Initiative , Diplomacy , Political , Logistics , Trade , Warfare , Technology , and Imperial . Any unchosen strategy cards receive bonus tokens which encourage players to choose them during the next strategy phase . Each player , in turn order , then takes one action . Actions can either be strategic - which involves using the primary ability of their strategy card - or tactical - which involves building and moving units and combat . Each player must use their primary strategy ability at some time during the turn , to allow the other players to use the secondary ability of that strategy . Players are limited in the number of actions they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tokens , which are divided between strategy ( used to access the secondary action of other players ' strategy cards ) , fleet supply ( limiting the number of ships that can occupy a system ) , and command pools ( used for tactical actions ) . Players continue taking actions in turn order until each player has passed . Units and technology can be purchased with a combination of planetary resources and Trade Goods . The Trade strategy allows players to exchange Trade Agreement cards , which then allow their holder to earn Trade Goods when the Trade strategy abilities are used . Combat plays much like ' ' Axis &amp; Allies ' ' . It is fought in rounds with each unit rolling one or more 10-sided dice to attempt to score hits on the enemy player , who is allowed a counter-attack with all their units before choosing which units are destroyed . Many aspects of play are modified both by the special abilities of the race the player is playing and by advanced technology the race controls . The Political strategy card can also introduce various laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws using the political influence ratings of the planets they control . The players also receive Action Cards each turn which can be used to tip the balance in combat or to gain other advantages for a turn . At the end of each turn the players have the opportunity to score victory points for one public goal that has been revealed and/or for their own secret objective ( each player begins the game with one random secret objective ) . The first player to achieve 10 victory points is declared the new Emperor and wins the game . There are a few other public goals that allow a player to win without having to score 10 victory points . Most games take four to six hours to complete , although games with six players or those new to the game can take longer . # Strategy # Generally each player will attempt to expand quickly into the unclaimed systems around their home world , and then use those resources to achieve the revealed public goals , which usually involve control or expenditure of resources , technology , or units ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not generally necessary to engage in combat in order to win the game . In the base game , half of the secret objectives ( which are all worth 2 victory points ) involve control of the former imperial capital Mecatol Rex , and controlling the planet grants the most political influence of any planet in the game . These facts and its central location usually lead to conflict over the ownership of Mecatol Rex . In the expansion , Shattered Empire , 5 out of 13 secret objectives involve control of Mecatol Rex . A decisive factor in most games is the choice of the Imperial Strategy card . Executing the card 's strategy immediately scores the controlling player 2 victory points , and reveals the next public goal card ( the only way outside of the secret objectives to score victory points ) . With a group of players that have previously played the game , the Imperial Strategy card generally circulates regularly around the table , with each player taking it as a first choice when possible , and a player who succeeds in taking the card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other players . The card effectively acts as a clock on the game , since it is almost always chosen each turn . Many fans were unhappy with the original Imperial Strategy Card , which they saw as far too powerful , and an alternate was included in the expansion , which allows a player to qualify for multiple objectives , instead of the usual one . # Variants and optional rules # The game comes with several optional rules and the counters necessary to play them out . Some of these were optional expansions in earlier editions of the game . The simplest variant is the long game , where the winner must score 14 victory points . The scoring track included with the game has two sides , one for the 10-point game and one for 14 . Many players play a variant of the game where the Imperial strategy card only scores 1 victory point for its owner . This reduces the importance of the Imperial Strategy card and allows for slightly longer games . The Shattered Empire expansion fixes most of the problems seen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a must have for the game to be playable . The Distant Suns variant places random counters on each neutral planet . These counters are revealed when first explored and can have a variety of beneficial or detrimental effects to the explorer . Three leader counters ( either admiral , diplomat , agent , general or scientist ) are included in the game for each race , each of which can provide special benefits for the ship or system they are present in . Additional optional rules and variants are included in the rulebook. # Twilight Imperium : Shattered Empire # Fantasy Flight Games released an expansion called ' ' Shattered Empire ' ' in December 2006 . It includes two new sets of playing pieces and additional system tiles , allowing for up to eight players to play a game , as well as many other additions . # Twilight Imperium : Shards of the Throne # Fantasy Flight Games released a second expansion called ' ' Shards of the Throne ' ' in May 2011 . It features new races , technologies , scenarios and plastic units , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editions # # Second Edition vs Third Edition # The third edition significantly changed many of the game mechanics . While some of the core elements remained the same , the game as a whole was completely revamped . Here are some of the more significant differences : * In 2E , only the Hacan , Letnev , N'orr , Jol-Nar , Sol , and Xxcha were playable races . The Mentak and Yssaril were introduced in the ' ' Hope 's End ' ' expansion as new playable races . The L1Z1X were present as non-player hostile invaders , introduced to gameplay via some of the events . The Naalu were completely new to the 3rd Edition ( although it first appeared in the first edition expansion : the outer rim ) . While the races present in both games kept the same basic flavor and feel , the racial abilities changed between editions . * In 2E , the game rounds were broken into phases : the political , production , movement , invasion , and technology steps . Each player had equal access to these phases every round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Strategy Cards , coupled with the new threaded activation sequence . * In 2E , players collected credits as tangible money that could be spent from round to round . 3E 's spending is mostly done by exhausting planets , though the Trade Good concept does allow some limited form of savable liquid assets . * In 2E , the only spaceships that could be built were Cruisers , Carriers , Dreadnoughts , and Fighters . 3E introduced Destroyers ( cheaper and weaker than Cruisers , but more mobile than Fighters ) , and War Suns ( expensive and powerful super ships ) . * While most of the technologies were ported from 2E to 3E , many of the effects changed significantly ( largely to fit with the 3E sequence better ) . * Politics in 2E was done at the beginning of each game round by drawing a card from a Political Card deck , and voting on the agenda . Some of these cards were events which automatically affected the game in some way ( such as introducing hostile L1Z1X forces ) . In 3E , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2E , players achieved victory by progressing along a fixed set of objectives , largely centered around the number of resources , influence , and planets controlled , as well as technologies . In 3E , players instead try to achieve Victory Points by completing objectives revealed during the game ; these objectives could change from game to game . * The tiles , cards , and playing pieces in the 3E are noticeably larger in size than their 2E counterparts . # List of games # # Main game ( first edition ) # * ' ' Twilight Imperium ' ' ** ' ' Twilight Imperium : Borderlands ' ' ** ' ' Twilight Imperium : Twilight Armada ' ' ** ' ' Twilight Imperium : Distant Suns ' ' ** ' ' Twilight Imperium : The Outer Rim ' ' # Main game ( second edition ) # * ' ' Twilight Imperium 2nd Edition ** ' ' Twilight Imperium : Hope 's End ' ' # Main game ( third edition ) # * ' ' Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition ' ' ** ' ' Twilight Imperium 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperium 3rd Edition - Shards of the Throne ' ' # Spin-off game # * ' ' Twilight Imperium : Armada ' ' ** ' ' Twilight Imperium : Armada : Stellar Matter ' ' ** ' ' Twilight Imperium : Armada : Incursion ' ' * ' ' Rex : Final days of an Empire ' '
