@@42472514 Epochalism an attitude of respect for the progressive spirit of the age and for social and technological advancement - was contrasted by Clifford Geertz with what he termed the ( essentialist ) valorisation of traditional values , as a central social polarity pervading developing nations . More broadly , the term used has been used to describe the post-Fordist , postmodern belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past ; is something unique in human history . # Polarities in emerging economies # Epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force , favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance , as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and Gemeinschaft . However , in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated : nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices , as well as to epochalism , in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western model/Western control . # Internet epochalism # The rapid rise of the World Wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human phenomenon , wholly divorced from all past experience . Evgeny Morozov used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that one is living in truly exceptional times an intellectual fallacy I call ' epochalism . Previous technological advances , as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting , had of course made very similar claims for themselves ; and A. E. Housman a century before had denounced the mind which commands no outlook upon the past or the future , but believes that the fashion of the present , unlike all fashions heretofore , will endure perpetually . Late modernity however , with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present , makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture .
