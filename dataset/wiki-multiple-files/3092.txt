@@27683514 John F. Shoch is an American computer scientist and venture capitalist who made significant contributions to the development of computer networking while at Xerox PARC , in particular to the development of the PARC Universal Protocol ( PUP ) , an important predecessor of TCP/IP . His contributions were significant enough to warrant including his name on the memorial plaque at Stanford University commemorating the Birth of the Internet. # Career # Shoch attended Stanford , where he earned a B.A. in political science ( 1971 ) ; he later went on to earn an M.S. ( 1977 ) and a Ph.D . ( 1979 ) in Computer Science from Stanford as well . His Ph.D . thesis was entitled Design and Performance of Local Computer Networks . He joined Xerox in 1971 , working at PARC , where his research interests included internetwork protocols , computer local area networks ( in particular the Ethernet , which he helped develop ) , packet radio , programming languages , and various other aspects of distributed systems . His best-known work from that period , after the Ethernet and PUP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident involves one that ran out of control , they were actually early experiments in distributed computing over a network of loosely-coupled machines . In 1980 , he became the assistant to the CEO of Xerox and director of the Corporate Policy Committee . In 1982 , he moved on to became president of Xerox 's Office Systems Division ( which developed network-based office systems derived from research performed at PARC ) . He left Xerox to become a venture capitalist with Asset Management Associates in 1985 , and then became a founding general partner at Alloy Ventures in 1996 . He has also taught at Stanford University , is a member of the ACM and the IEEE , and serves as a trustee for the Computer History Museum . # Publications # * David R. Boggs , John F.
