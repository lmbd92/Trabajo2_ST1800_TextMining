' ' Threads of Fate ' ' revolves around two characters , Rue and Mint , and their adventure for a mystical object known only as the relic . Though an official sequel was never released , a fan-made sequel called Duo Princess was created for the PC in Japanese . # Gameplay # The gameplay is simple and action-oriented rather than turn-based , playing more like an action platformer than a traditional menu-based RPG such as those in the ' ' Final Fantasy ' ' series . It is more similar in style to the ' ' Mana ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zelda ' ' series by Nintendo . The lead female character , Mint , attacks with a pair of chakrams , known as the Dual Haloes , and is a proficient magic user . The lead male character , Rue , is more physical and attacks with his axe , Arc Edge . He also has the ability to transform into some of the monsters he defeats , utilizing their attacks and powers . The ring menu used to select Mint 's magic attacks or Rue 's shape-shifting is reminiscent of the menu system in ' ' Secret of Mana ' ' . At the beginning of the game , the player is given the choice of playing through the game as either Mint or Rue . Depending on the selection , the game proceeds with one of two storylines . Though the quests are very similar , the storylines themselves have a branching quality that brings certain scenarios to life in one storyline without remotely mentioning them in the other . Completing both games will give the player a holistic storyline to weave together from the two , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mint and Rue 's story will show you that Rue and Mint 's sister Maya found another doll , ' ' Dolls of Valen ' ' .

' ' Threads of Fate ' ' has a reasonably uncomplicated story and ( save for its rather unexpected plot twist ) harbors minimal surprise and suspense , with its greatest story pull being in its character interactions , aided by flawless localization . The simplicity of the story makes its theme oddly obtuse , however . The game 's storyline is based heavily on the distinction between immutable destiny and choice . This is most obvious in Rue 's storyline , as he gives many speeches near the end of the game about fighting the will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the more important characters also follow through on this theme . Another example of this is Mint 's destiny . Because she was thrown from her position , it cast her out of high fate . In response to this , she decided to write her own destiny by skipping the formality of ruling a kingdom and instead simply seeking to take over the world . Rod 's fate , too , was written by his father Pleskin , and he expected to be the greatest swordsman of all time , capable of defeating his father , who held the title . Because Pleskin died , Rod was left to wallow in the despair of never being able to surpass his father 's legacy until Lucine helped him realize that he need n't be tied by his assumed fate . He instead became a **26;11693;TOOLONG , determined to surpass his father 's legacy in his own way , by becoming the greatest weapon crafter known to the world . # Development and release # # Manga # A manga based on the game was planned to be made by Ken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the project was scrapped .

Hidenori Iwasaki did the score 's synthesizer programming . A soundtrack was released in Japan ( titled ' ' Dewprism OST ' ' ) and was available via import for several years in other countries .

The OST has two discs , Disc RUE and Disc MINT , featuring all of the tracks played throughout the game . The tracks are divided between the discs according to which character they fit best . Much of the mellower music is contained on Rue 's disc , with a fairly small selection of ' happy ' tracks or battle tracks , while Mint 's disc contains almost all of the more intrusive tracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PlayStation Network re-release # On May 4 , 2010 Square Enix announced ' ' Threads of Fate ' ' will be released for PlayStation Network .
