@@910514 ' ' Arctocephalus forsteri ' ' , also known as the New Zealand fur seal or southern fur seal , is a species of fur seal found around the south coast of Australia , the coast of the South Island of New Zealand , and some of the small islands to the south and east of there . Male-only colonies are also located on the Cook Strait coast of the North Island near Wellington and vagrants are found as far north as New Caledonia . The English common name New Zealand fur seal is used by English speakers in New Zealand ( ' ' kekeno ' ' is used in the Mori language ) , and southern fur seal by English speakers in Australia . Although the two populations show some genetic differences , their morphologies are very similar , and thus they remain classed as a single species . Although the seals look docile , they can move surprisingly quickly and it is advisable never to approach a female with young or get between a seal and the water , cutting off its escape route to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal is a fairly large mammal . Males have been reported to be as large as 250 kg in the literature , but the average weight is about 126 kg . Males can also grow to be 2 meters long . Females are between 3050 kg on average , and can grow to be as long as 1.5 meters . Pups are 3.3-3.9 kg on average , and between 40 and 55 cm long . At 290 days old males are about 14.1 kg , and females are about 12.6 kg . They have external ears and hind flippers that rotate forward , which visibly distinguish them from other seals . They have a pointy nose with long pale whiskers . The fur seals are covered by two layers of fur , and their coat is grey-brown on their back , but it is lighter on their belly . Some fur seals have white tips on longer upper hairs , which can give the fur seal a silver like appearance . # Behavioral Characteristics # # Diving # New Zealand fur seals porpoise out of the water when traveling quickly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diving out of any other fur seal because they can dive deeper and longer . Females can dive for about 9 minutes and to a depth of about 312 meters . But females can dive deeper and longer in autumn and winter . Males can dive for about 15 minutes to a depth of about 380 meters . On average New Zealand fur seals only dive for 12 minutes . When they dive for food they dive deeper during the day but shallower at night , because during the day their prey typically migrates to deeper depths and migrates back up during the night . # Communication # Males vocalize through a bark or whimper , either a gluttural threat , a low-intensity threat , a full threat , or a submissive call . Females growl and also have a high-pitched pup attraction wail call . # Breeding # Female New Zealand fur seals mature between 4 and 6 years old , and males mature between 8 and 10 years old . These seals are polygynous . Males obtain and guard territory in late October before females arrive . Often females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight days postpartum for about 13 minutes on average . Females have a delayed implantation of the fertilized egg , so that implantation on the uterine wall does not occur for 3 months . Gestation occurs for 9 months Females are more aggressive near the time of birth , and do not like to be approached right after birth . Female New Zealand fur seals will continue to reproduce until their death which is on average between 14 and 17 years of age . # Parenting # Pups are born between November and January . Females stay close to the birth site for up to ten days . Pups are fairly mature at birth , and within 60 minutes they start suckling for about 7 minutes . Eventually the suckling can exceed 33 minutes . Suckling can occur for about 300 days . Pups start to eat solid food just before weaning . Pups are eventually weaned around September , and they disperse . # Diet # Their diet includes cephalopods , fish , and birds . Stomach contents have been analyzed and shown to include anchovy , barracuda , flounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many other species . There are different factors that affect their diet , such as season , sex , breeding , surrounding colony , oceanography , and climatic patterns . # Predators # New Zealand fur seals known predators are killer whales , sharks , male New Zealand sea lions , and possibly leopard seals . New Zealand sea lions are also known to target pups as their prey . # Human Impact # These seals were widely hunted from shortly after the European discovery of New Zealand until the late 19th century . The population of the New Zealand seal fell to levels under 10% of the original numbers . Today trawls and fisheries are one of the main sources of death in New Zealand fur seals . They cause entanglement and drowning . It has been estimated by the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society that over 10000 seals could have drowned in nets between 1989 and 1998 . They are also known to be shot by commercial and recreational fishermen , because they sometimes interfere with fishing gear . How often these shootings occur is unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected to increase . New Zealand fur seals have recently received protection by the creation of a 16 million hectare Marine Park that is located on the eastern side of Macquarie island in 2000 . The Tasmanian government has also extended to Macquarie Island Nature Reserve by 3 nautical miles surrounding the island . New Zealand fur seals are protected by the Marine mammals protection act of 1978 , which works to conserve marine animal species . <gallery> File:Arctocephalus forsteri LC0255.jpgNew Zealand fur seal ' ' Arctocephalus forsteri ' ' , South Island , New Zealand Image:Squinting seal.jpegNew Zealand fur seal coming ashore below Taiaroa Head , near Dunedin Image:Seal Cubs-Palliser Bay-20070331.jpgNew Zealand fur seal cubs at Palliser Bay </gallery>
