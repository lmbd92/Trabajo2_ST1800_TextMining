@@29066514 ' ' Porky 's Preview ' ' is a short film of animation produced by Leon Schlesinger and directed by Tex Avery . It features Porky Pig . The film was released on 19 April 1941 , distributed by Warner Bros . Pictures . # Plot # Porky Pig has arranged the screening of a film in a film theater for an audience of barnyard animals . The public goes to the ticket booth . A chicken buys tickets for herself and her three children ( eggs ) . A kangaroo tears the tickets ( and even the hand that holds it ) and throws them in his pouch . A firefly usher leads the audience with his hindquarters as bright lamp . A skunk has a scent ( pun on smelling it , and 1 cent of a dollar ) and can not enter , so he goes through the back door . On stage Porky presents the film he made himself . The accompanying music is a version of the flickering that usually introduced cartoons of Looney Tunes . The film turns out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , minimalist , with settings that seem to have been penciled by a child . After the film , Porky is surprised to see the theatre in shambles the only audience that remaining is the skunk ( whose presence drove away everyone else ) . # Analysis # The basic premise of the film is that a 7-years-old Porky has created a homemade animated cartoon , and demonstrates it to an audience willing to pay an admission fee . The artistic skills of the child are minimal , so the film within a film is depicted in a very simple style . Effectively serving as a parody of its art form . All fictional characters within it are drawn as stick figures , while the animation style is reminiscent of a flip book . For this film within a film , Tex Avery uses a series of blackout gags . Carl Stalling accompanies each joke with a tune already familiar to the audience . Among them are ' ' La Cucaracha ' ' ( first mentioned c. 1819 ) , ' ' Aloha Oe ' ' ( 1878 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written between 1875 and 1895 ) . Stalling also parodies the typical music score of shorts produced by Warner Bros . Cartoons . The credits of the film within a film makes use of ' ' The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down ' ' ( 1937 ) , but the familiar tune is simplified . Giving the impression that it is played by an amateur . A number of notes are repeated , in the style of a broken record which repeats over and over . The film includes some references to war . When a skunk approaches the box office , the lady working there wears a gas mask to endure its scent . The self-portrait of Porky is marked as draft No. . # Censorship # When aired on TV ( particularly when aired on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network ) , the September in the Rain segment is cut .
