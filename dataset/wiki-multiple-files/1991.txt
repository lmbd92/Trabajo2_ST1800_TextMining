@@15396514 tracklength = el = No elevation = The HolmestrandVittingfoss Line ( ) or HVB is an abandoned railway between Holmestrand to Hvittingfoss in Norway . It consisted of two sections : a 13.4 km line from Holmestrand to Hillestad and a 10.4 km section from Hof to Hvittingfoss . The two parts were connected by a 6km 0 section of the TnsbergEidsfoss Line . At Holmestrand Station , the line connected to the Vestfold Line of the Norwegian State Railways . HVB was opened on 30 September 1902 and closed on 1 June 1938 . The main purpose of the line was the transport of wood pulp at Hvittingfoss , although it was also used for passenger transport until 1931. # Route # The narrow gauge railway executed a steep climb from Holmestrand to Hvittingfoss . It had a maximum gradient of 2.5 percent , a minimum curve radius of and a track weight of 17.5 kg/m . At Holmestrand , the line followed a zig-zap pattern up the hill , forcing the trains to back into Holmestand Station . Located up from Holmestrand is a the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line is 13.4 km . There , it runs concurrently with the TnsbergEidsfoss Line for 6km 0 , before splitting again at Hof and running 10.4 km to Hvittingfoss . In Holmestrand there was a spur to Nordisk Aluminium , which remained in use as a branch of the Vestfold Line until 1984 . In Holmestrand , the locomotive shed is still in use , although urban growth has removed all other remains of the line . The right-of-way out of town is used as a suburban street . The tunnel has fallen into disuse , but from there the right-of-way is used as a trail . Towards Hillestad the railway ran in agricultural land , which has been reclaimed . The last few kilometers towards Hillestad , the route is used as a forestry road . From Hof , the right-of-way is gone , but along the last section down to Hvittingfoss , the right-of-way remains as a forestry road . The station and freight house have been preserved . # History # # Planning # Proposals for a Vestfold Line arose in the late 1860s and accelerated through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should run , with three major proposals : along the shore of the Oslofjord , along Eikeren to Eidsfoss and through an inland route to Tnsberg , and via Lgendalen to Larvik . The Eidsfoss alternative allowed the line to run through an area with good access to lumber , which the railway would aid export . The main disadvantage was that the route was 20 km longer than via the coast . Other minor plans included a Svarstad Line which would have run from Horten via Skoppum and Svarstad to Hvittingfoss . It was mostly seen as a supplement to the Lgendal Line , should it have been built . The issue was not resolved until Parliament on 8 June 1875 voted in favor of a coastal route . The narrow gauge Vestfold Line , at the time named the Jarlsberg Line , opened in 1881 . Engineer C. F. Melby proposed during the 1890s that the Svarstad Line be built . It was proposed to branch from the Vestfold Line at Skoppum Station , the same station the Horten Line branches from . It was proposed as a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being designed with sharp curves and steep gradients . The basis at Skoppum allowed the shortest distance to a coastal station . The line was proposed run along Undrumsdal , Fosaas , through Fossan , Firing , Holt , Sjuve , Vivestad and Vasss before reaching Svarstad . IT would then have run north through Lgendalen to Hvittingfoss . This gave a not too complicated construction , allowing costs to be low . The line received support in Horten , and with a single decisive vote the municipal council voted in favor of a NOK 150,000 grant of the total NOK 1.4 million in estimated construction cots . However , it met little support in other political bodies and was soon scrapped . Instead a shorter line from Holmestrand to Hvittingfoss was favored . The main incentive to build a railway was caused by Vittingfoss Brug . The pulp mill had been established by Andrers Olai Handeborg in 1872 . Although located in a good location in relation to power and access to lumber , its interior location made transport of the pulp difficult . It bought a steam tractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to use and it was soon abandoned . The company therefore started arguing that it needed a railway . Handeborg lost omost of his fortune in the stock market crash of 1899 and the mill was taken over by the banks . In 1902 they sold it to the British publisher Edward Lloyd and the company took the name Vittingfoss Bruk . Demands for a railway to Hvittingfoss came as a response to the planning of the TnsbergEidsfoss Line . From the point of view of interests from Holmestrand , they were worried that the town would lose its surrounding area to Tnsberg , and hence its basis for trade . A committee was created , consisting of Birch , N. G. Berg and Chr . Bettum . They concluded that they railway should be built as cheap as possible , and proposed that 750 millimeter ( 2 ft in ) gauge be used . This would cause a break of gauge in Holmestrand , but the committee argued that nearly all traffic would be transferred to boats at Holmestrand , so this would not incur much costs . Hvittingfoss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares forth NOK 100,000 if this was chosen . The committee further proposed shortening the line by building part of it as a rack railway , allowing for steeper gradients. # Construction # The railway was approved by Parliament on 24 July 1896 , at the same time as the TnsbergEidsfoss Line . The original budget was NOK 728,000 . The line was to be built and operated as a private railway . Construction of the TnsbergEidsfoss Line commenced in 1898 , and this line was built with , the same as the Vestfold Line . Because HVB desired to have the same gauge as TEB to allow for a concurrency , HVB 's gauge was therefore changed to gauge . The alternative was to build the section with dual gauge . The issue resulted in disagreements between the parties , but in the end the pulp mill agreed to maintain their financing despite the gauge change . A proposal to electrify the railway was proposed , but the NOK 250,000 cost was not found to pay off and therefore scrapped . The line was surveyed twice , with the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives could be chosen along the common section with TEB , with a line via stbygden being discarded in favor of one north of Hillestadvannet . There was during the late planning stages a proposal to increase the minimum curve radius from 100to150 m , but this was discarded after the government would not allocate the additional necessary funding . One of the major delays during construction was the Innlofjellet Tunnel , which suffered several landslides , one which partially flooded the town . Five alternatives were proposed in Holmestrand , which variously included sharing NSB 's Holmestrand Station or building a separate station . The municipal council supported on 20 November 1900 an alternative with a separate station at the towns square , with a branch via Gausen to NSB 's station . Estimated to cost NOK 43,000 , this was the cheapest alternative . NSB opposed this , stating that it could cause operational problems for them at Holmestrand Station , but gave permission for the connection line on 26 August 1902 . Laying of the permanent way started on 28 September 1901 . The construction cost ended at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rest was paid for by municipalities and private individuals and companies . With the increase to gauge , a further NOK 100,000 was granted on 28 March 1896 . The state increased its investments twice more as costs continued to increase , based on decisions in Parliament for a raise of NOK 74,000 on 29 May 1900 and a raise of NOK 30,000 on 20 May 1902 . These increased fundings were met with equal increased local funding . A fatal accident occurred on 1 October 1902 , when the final inspection was being carried out . The inspector had not been informed of an extra maintenance of way train , and he was run down while on the tracks . The official opening took place the following day , on 2 October 1902. # Early operational history # HVB and TEB signed an agreement concerning the operation of the concurrent section . TEB was given the operational responsibility , although both railways were free to use it . All transshipment was to take place at Hillestad Station . Both companies retained their revenue , while HVB compensated TEB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included that the two lines would share a sixth of TEB 's administration costs , based jointly on the number of trains and the revenue from the concurrent section . Any upgrades to the section would be split between the two companies . Operational costs were split based on the ration of the number of trains and the number of axles . If the two companies could not agree on the calculation , NSB 's district chief in Drammen would arbitrate . HVB bought t is first two steam locomotives from Krauss &amp; Co. of Germany . They were numbered 1 and 2 , and named ' ' Holmestrand ' ' and ' ' Vittingfoss ' ' . The company also bought three two-axle passenger cars and twenty-four freight cars . In 1902 , ' ' Holmestrand ' ' was sold to TEB , because they had problems with their locomotives . The railway bought three passenger carriages , one which also had a second class compartment . Although it had a standard almost comparable to NSB 's first class , it saw little use and nearly all passengers traveled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior . On the one hand it provided a fast and efficient way to reach the coastal towns , but many farmers lost and important supplementary income after they were no longer needed to perform transport services for Vittingfoss Bruk . The first full operation year , in 1903 , resulted in 19,446 passengers and a profit of NOK 1,556.71 . The following year ridership increased dramatically , to 45,418 . Also freight increased , from 10,887 to 25,820 tonnes . This caused additional rolling stock to be procured . New freight cars were built at Eidsfoss Verk and a new locomotive was built by Thune . Delivered in October 1904 , it was also named ' ' Holmestrand ' ' , and was identical to a class being built for the Lier Line . Thune delivered the railway 's fourth locomotive in 1909 . By then the railway had 53 freight cars . The company had a profit of NOK 29,714 in 1910 . Transshipment between HVB and NSB initially cost HVB NOK 38.25 per car . The track arrangement from Gausen to Holmestrand Station caused operational difficulties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new section also served Nordisk Aluminium . In 1907 HVB transshipped 114 tonnes of express cargo and 13,553 tonnes of regular cargo to NSB . HVB 's cars drove a combined 8042km sp=us on NSB lines . The annual amounts varied , with the express cargo following to 20 tonnes and regular cargo 878 tonnes by 1911 . Then traffic rose , reaching 140 and 5,600 tonnes , respectively , in 1920 . A peak cargo of 73,196 tonnes was transported in 1915 . Although HVB was profitable , TEB failed after the initial years to make money on its operation . There therefore arose a proposal for HVB to take over all operations north of Hillestad , and relegate the southern part of TEB to a suburban line for Tnsberg . The proposal came from the HVB 's board , who saw the possibility of using existing crew and rolling stock to operate trains from Eidsfoss to Holmestrand . It would have increased the number of daily services from Hillestad to Holmestrand from two to four . The proposals was rejected by the municipal councils in Tnsberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEB . The passenger transport from Hvittingfoss increased until the 1910s , when it stabilized at about 50,000 passengers per year , before peaking at 90,910 in 1918 . However , high coal prices drew up operating costs , even though the railway in part started using wood as fuel . The company had a deficit of NOK 30,293 in 1918 . The next two years the ridership fell by a third , while the company 's costs for fuel increased to NOK 80,424 to NOK 156,540 . The company went with a loss until 1923 , when traffic started increasing again . The highest profit , of NOK 61,602 , was recorded in 1925 . The following year Hasestad Station burned down in a fire , and the wharfs in Holmestrand collapsed because it could not support the amount of pulp being stored there . Freight traffic continued to fall in the following years . Patronage until the late 1920s , when between 20,000 and 30,000 passengers per year were transported . A bus service through Lgendalen started in 1910 , providing services from Vittingfoss to Kongsberg and Larvik . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part as a compensation for the valley not receiving a railway . The responsibility was given to NSB , who 's bus division started a route from Larvik via Svarstad to Kongsberg . The main challenge was finding a suitable vehicle to operate the service during winter . The service included one daily route to Vittingfoss , which corresponded with the train . The route was not favorable for the railway company . The bus service gave little new traffic to the railway , while the railway fed considerable traffic to the bus service , although few passengers transferred between the two . # Termination of passenger services # All services on the line were mix trains , which resulted in long stops at station to load and unload cargo . Trains would be delayed , causing passengers to instead ride with unscheduled buses . HVB cosidered buying a railcar , and borrowed one from NSB , but found it was not powerful enough to get up the steep gradients . Instead the company bought a bus in 1925 , which was to operate a single daily round service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit was increasing . The state guaranteed for NOK 18,000 , but demanded that the remaining loss be covered by the municipalities . Costs were proposed cut by closing the workshop in Holmestrand . HVB attempted to secure a deal with NSB in which the latter would effectively subsidize the maintenance , but this was rejected by NSB . The result was that a few jobs were cut in Holmestrand and maintenance continued as before . Additional cost savings were carried out by reducing maintenance of the track to a bare minimum . HVB experienced a sharp increase of ridership to 51,442 in 1928 , just to see it fall down to 25,000 the following year and to 21,157 in 1930 . HVB attempted to increase their traffic by reducing their fares , both for passengers and freight . The company also experienced that many shippers overloaded the cars . In addition to the loss of revenue , if the car was to continue with NSB , it was often required to be transshipped , at the cost of HVB . This was particularly a problem with lumber . An easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not resolved until it was discovered that a correctly loaded car would just allow a match box to fit between the car 's frame and bogie spring . The company therefore announced on 27 January 1931 that it intended to terminate all passenger trains from 1 March . This would give cost savings of NOK 30,000 , as all employees who worked with expedition of passengers could be laid off , reducing the number of employees at intermediate stations from thirty to seven . The company would expand its bus service , which it expected to make a profit from . The trains could be optimized for freight timetables , giving additional cost savings . The bus was not delivered until September , postponing the termination of passenger operations to 27 September . The company was able to make a profit of NOK 157 in 1932 . The closing of the passenger train service received mixed reactions . On the one hand it was possible to reach Holmestrand up to an hour earlier , but on the other hand the ride was much less comfortable . This was in part caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter than the railway , as it could allow for steeper climbs . From 1932 Vittingfoss Bruk started a harder line in their negotiations with the railway . They contracted part of the pulp freighting to truck drivers , and demanded discounts from the railway company . This caused HVB to make a NOK 5,000 loss that year . The following year Vittingfoss Bruk stopped sending any cargo with HVB , which had a dramatic effect on HVB . The company 's board started intense negotiations to find new sources of revenue or areas to cut costs , and proposed both closing down the line and a merger with TEB. # Merger and closing # NSB carried out a survey to look into the future of HVB and TEB . The report recommended that borth the branch from Eidsfoss and Hvittingfoss run to Holmestrand and that the section from Hillestad to Tnsberg . By then Hvittingfoss Bruk had been bought by Tnsberg Municipality , and to retain the transshipment jobs at the town 's port , the municipal council insisted on that the pulp mill send its pulp to Tnsberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was met with resistance in Holmestrand , as an estimated 44 people would lose their jobs and Viking Melk would possibly have to close down . To rationalize operations , HVB and TEB were merged on 23 August 1934 through the creation of a new railway company , Vestfold Privatbaner . Holmestrand protested against the head office being located in Tnsberg and decided to not buy shares in the company . This further relegated their influence over the line and operations . Vestfold Privatbaner had a troubled economy , as Vittingfoss Bruk repeatedly shut down production . The railway company 's director thus in 1936 started the process of closing the segment from Hillestad to Holmestrand , and from 1936 only irregular trains ran on the segment . A youth fair resulted in a several charter trains being run on 13 June 1937 . The final revenue train was a series of half-completed freight trains which were being built by Eidsfoss Verk . Because of the uncertain future of the line , they decided to transfer production to Sundland in Drammen and the unfinished cars were sent via HVB. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 with the intension of establishing a heritage railway . It first attempted to establish itself at Kopstad Station , but instead settled for Kleppen Station . It was at the time intact with a full inventory , including such items as a complete storage of unused tickets . Several of the railway carriages were identified , most of them used as cabins . One person offered to donate two carriages , with original interior and coloring , but after a building permit was rejected he instead chose to burn them down . A representative traveled to Sweden , where he was able to purchase narrow-gauge rolling stock . Clearing of the line at Hillestad started in May 1968 and station building at Kleppen was attempted transported up to Hillestad . However , the truck carrying the building had an accident and the building was smashed . The heritage enthusiasm died out .
