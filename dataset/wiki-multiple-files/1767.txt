The bedrock of the island is Lewisian gneiss . The hillock of ' ' Cnoc a ' Chombaiste ' ' is found to the northeast . The other main geomorphological features are ' ' Acarseid Mr ' ' ( big harbour ) to the west a shallow and weedy inlet with a rocky shore and Loch Hermetray at the island 's centre . There are numerous surrounding islets . The largest is Vaccasay or ' ' Bhacasaigh ' ' ( island with a bay ) which extends to and lies to the west . Along with Fuam to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheltered Basin of Vaccasay . Fuam 's full name in Gaelic is ' ' Fuam an Aon Fhoid ' ' , meaning far out isle of the one peat a reference to its shallow soils . Greineam and the skerries of Staffin and Creag na Stead lie to the north in the Grey Horse Channel and Grodaigh and the once fortified Dun Mhic Leathann to the south , beyond the ' ' Selaid na h-Eala ' ' and close to North Uist . This strait is named after the ' ' Eala Bhn ' ' ( white swan ) , a famous 17th century ' ' birlinn ' ' . ' ' Selaid ' ' means a sailing channel , fairway in the sea or anchorage . Further northwest is the Cabbage Patch , a complex group of reefs and skerries including the islets of Opasaigh , Srstaigh and Nrstaigh. # History # The island 's name is Norse , ' ' Hermunr-y ' ' meaning Hermund 's Island , although it is not known who this person was . The Ordnance Survey also refer to the islet by its Gaelic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hermodray that it was a : ' ' half mile lang , fertile and frutfull ' ' . Martin Martin visited the island in 1695 and said of it , that it had : ' ' moorish soil , covered all over almost in heath , except here and there , with a few piles of grass and the plant milkwort . Yet not withstanding this disadvantage , it is certainly the best spot of its extent for pasturage amongst these isles , and affords plenty of milk in January and February beyond what can be seen in other islands . ' ' Martin Martin also mentions that there is : : ' ' the foundation of a house built by the English in the reign of King Charles the First 's time , for one of their magazines to lay up the cask , salt etc , for carrying on the fishery , which was then begun in the Western Islands ; but this design miscarried because of the civil wars which then broke out . ' ' Martin was referring to Lord Seaforth 's fishery , set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . It was part of Charles I 's Company of the General Fishery of Great Britain &amp; Ireland . In 1841 , a population of 8 was recorded as living on the island in a single household . Ordnance Survey maps published in 1881 showed six unroofed buildings on the island , which has remained uninhabited since the mid 19th century . A sheep fank at Acarseid Mr may be on the site of the 1841 house . North Uist was much affected by the Highland Clearances from where there was large scale emigration to Cape Breton in Canada but no certain reasons for the abandonment of Hermetray have come to light . In 1921 , a Norwegian ship , the ' ' Puritan ' ' was wrecked here . Reportedly the three survivors would not partake of a crate of whisky which was wrecked with them , and did not thank their rescuer , Alasdair Beag of Berneray , when he arranged for them to be returned to their home country . The Hebrideans explained this by the name of the ship , although it should be pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heremtray is currently owned by the Scottish Government and there is a fish farm in the Basin of Vaccasay. # Wildlife # Gulls and buzzards nest in the low cliffs and escaped American mink have been trapped on the island during an eradication programme . Fish are absent from Loch Hermetray . The flora includes adder 's tongue , flag iris , bog cotton , ragged robin and white clover . # In popular culture # In the ' ' Harry Potter ' ' universe , at some point in the 16th Century Zygmunt Budge , an accomplished maker of potions , took up residence on Hermetray after leaving Hogwarts in protest at the age of 14 . Living alone , he continued his studies and eventually wrote the ' ' Book of Potions ' ' . # Notes #
