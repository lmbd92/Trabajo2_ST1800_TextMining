@@288514 Pixies ( also pixy , pixi , pizkie , piskies and pigsies as they are sometimes known in Cornwall ) are mythical creatures of folklore , considered to be particularly concentrated in the high moorland areas around Devon and Cornwall , suggesting some Celtic origin for the belief and name . Akin to the Irish and Scottish Aos S , pixies are believed to inhabit ancient underground ancestor sites such as stone circles , barrows , dolmens , ringfort or menhirs . In traditional regional lore , pixies are generally benign , mischievous , short of stature and attractively childlike ; they are fond of dancing and gather outdoors in huge numbers to dance or sometimes wrestle , through the night , demonstrating parallels with the Cornish plen-an-gwary and Breton Fest Noz ( Cornish : troyl ) folk celebrations originating in the medieval period . In modern times they are usually depicted with pointed ears , and often wearing a green outfit and pointed hat . Sometimes their eyes are described as being pointed upwards at the temple ends . These , however , are Victorian era conventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , the term can be synonymous with fairies or sprites . However , in folklore there is a traditional enmity , even war , between the two races . # Etymology and origin # The origin of the name ' ' pixie ' ' is uncertain . Some have speculated that it comes from the Swedish dialectal ' ' pyske ' ' meaning ' ' wee little fairy ' ' . Others , however , have disputed this , given there is no plausible case for Nordic dialectical survivals in southwest Britiain , and claiming instead that due to the Cornish origin of the ' ' piskie ' ' that the term is more probably Celtic in origin , though no direct ancestor of the word is known , however the term ' ' Pobel Vean ' ' ( ' Little People ' ) is often used to refer to them collectively . Very similar analogues exist in closely related Irish ( Aos Si ) and Breton ( korrigan ) culture , although their common names are unrelated , even within areas of language survival there is a very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for pixie is ' ' spriggan ' ' this being the area of late survival of the Cornish language where ' ' spriggan ' ' s are distinguished from pixies by their malevolent nature . Closely associated with tin mining in Cornwall are the subterranean ancestral knockers . Pixie mythology is believed to pre-date Christian presence in Britain . In the Christian era they were sometimes said to be the souls of children who had died un-baptised . These children would change their appearance to pixies once their clothing was placed in clay funeral pots used in their earthly lives as toys . By 1869 some were suggesting that the name pixie was a racial remnant of Pictic tribes who used to paint and tattoo their skin blue , an attribute often given to pixies . This suggestion is still met in contemporary writing , but there is no proven connection and the etymological connection is doubtful . Some 19th-century researchers made more general claims about pixie origins , or have connected them with the Puck , ( Cornish Bucca ) a mythological creature sometimes described as a fairy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advent of more modern fiction , pixie mythology was localised to Britain . Some have noted similarities to northern fairies , Germanic and Scandinavian elves , but pixies are distinguished from them by the myths and stories of Devon and Cornwall . # Cornwall and Devon # Before the mid-19th century , pixies and fairies were taken seriously in much of Cornwall and Devon . Books devoted to the homely beliefs of the peasantry are filled with incidents of pixie manifestations . Some locales are named for the pixies associated with them . In Devon , near Challacombe , a group of rocks are named for the pixies said to dwell there . At Trevose Head in Cornwall 600 pixies were said to have gathered dancing and laughing in a circle that had appeared upon the turf until one of their number , named Omfra , lost his laugh . After searching amongst the barrows of the ancient kings of Cornwall on St Breock Downs , he wades through the bottomless Dozmary Pool on Bodmin Moor until his laugh is restored by King Arthur in the form of a Chough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real beings persists . In the legends associated with Dartmoor , pixies ( or piskeys ) are said to disguise themselves as a bundle of rags to lure children into their play . The pixies of Dartmoor are fond of music and dancing and for riding on Dartmoor colts . These pixies are generally said to be helpful to normal humans , sometimes helping needy widows and others with housework . They are not completely benign however , as they have a reputation for misleading travellers ( being pixy-led , the remedy for which is to turn your coat inside out ) . The queen of the Cornish pixies is said to be Joan the Wad ( torch ) , and she is considered to be good luck or bring good luck . In Devon , pixies are said to be invisibly small , and harmless or friendly to man . In some of the legends and historical accounts they are presented as having near-human stature . For instance , a member of the Elford family in Tavistock , Devon , successfully hid from Cromwells troops in a pixie house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , a natural cavern on Sheep Tor , is still accessible . At Buckland St. Mary , Somerset , pixies and fairies are said to have battled each other . Here the pixies were victorious and still visit the area , whilst the fairies are said to have left after their loss . By the early 19th century their contact with humans had diminished . In Samuel Drews 1824 book ' ' Cornwall ' ' one finds the observation : The age of pixies , like that of chivalry , is gone . There is , perhaps , at present hardly a house they are reputed to visit . Even the fields and lanes which they formerly frequented seem to be nearly forsaken . Their music is rarely heard . # #Pixie Day# # Pixie Day is an old tradition which takes place annually in the East Devon town of Ottery St. Mary in June . The day commemorates a legend of pixies being banished from the town to local caves known as the Pixie 's Parlour . The Pixie Day legend originates from the early days of Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otteri ( Ottery St. Mary ) , and commissioned a set of bells to come from Wales , and to be escorted by monks on their journey . On hearing of this , the pixies were worried , as they knew that once the bells were installed it would be the death knell of their rule over the land . So they cast a spell over the monks to redirect them from the road to Otteri to the road leading them to the cliff 's edge at Sidmouth . Just as the monks were about to fall over the cliff , one of the monks stubbed his toe on a rock and said God bless my soul and the spell was broken . The bells were then brought to Otteri and installed . However , the pixies ' spell was not completely broken ; each year on a day in June the pixies come out and capture the town 's bell ringers and imprison them in Pixies ' Parlour to be rescued by the Vicar of Ottery St. Mary . This legend is re-enacted each year by the Cub and Brownie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pixies ' Parlour in the Town Square ( the original Pixie 's Parlour can be found along the banks of the River Otter ) . # Characteristics # Pixies are variously described in folklore and fiction . They are often described as ill-clothed or naked . In 1890 , William Crossing noted a pixie 's preference for bits of finery : Indeed , a sort of weakness for finery exists among them , and a piece of ribbon appears to be .. highly prized by them . Some pixies are said to steal children or to lead travellers astray . This seems to be a cross-over from fairy mythology and not originally attached to pixies ; in 1850 , Thomas Keightley observed that much of Devon pixie mythology may have originated from fairy myth . Pixies are said to reward consideration and punish neglect on the part of larger humans , for which Keightley gives examples . By their presence they bring blessings to those who are fond of them . Pixies are drawn to horses , riding them for pleasure and making tangled ringlets in the manes of those horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caves of the ocean , the hidden sources of the streams and the recesses of the land . Some find pixies to have a human origin or to partake of human nature , in distinction to fairies whose mythology is traced to immaterial and malignant spirit forces . In some discussions pixies are presented as wingless , pygmy-like creatures , however this is probably a later accretion to the mythology . One British scholar stated his belief that Pixies were evidently a smaller race , and , from the greater obscurity of the .. tales about them , I believe them to have been an earlier race . # Literary interpretations # Many Victorian era poets saw them as magical beings . An example is Samuel Minturn Peck : in his poem ' ' The Pixies ' ' he writes : : T is said their forms are tiny , yet : : All human ills they can subdue , : Or with a wand or amulet : : Can win a maidens heart for you ; : And many a blessing know to stew : : To make to wedlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : : The Pixies are abroad tonight . The late 19th century English poet Nora Chesson summarised pixie mythology fairly well in a poem entitled ' ' The Pixies ' ' . She gathered all the speculations and myths into verse : : Have eer you seen the Pixies , the fold not blest or banned ? : They walk upon the waters ; they sail upon the land , : They make the green grass greener whereer their footsteps fall , : The wildest hind in the forest comes at their call . : They steal from bolted linneys , they milk the key at grass , : The maids are kissed a-milking , and no one hears them pass . : They flit from byre to stable and ride unbroken foals , : They seek out human lovers to win them souls . : The Pixies know no sorrow , the Pixies feel no fear , : They take no care for harvest or seedtime of the year ; : Age lays no finger on them , the reaper time goes by : The Pixies , they who change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pixies though they love us , behold us pass away , : And are not sad for flowers they gathered yesterday , : To-day has crimson foxglove . : If purple hose-in-hose withered last night : To-morrow will have its rose . She touches on all the essentials , including even more modern accretions . Pixies are in-between , not cursed by God or especially blessed . They do the unexpected , they bless the land , and are forest creatures whom other wild creatures find alluring and non-threatening . They love humans , taking some for mates , and are nearly ageless . They are winged , flitting from place to place . The Pixie Day tradition in Samuel Taylor Coleridges hometown of Ottery St Mary in East Devon was the inspiration for his poem ' ' Song of the Pixies ' ' . The Victorian era writer Mary Elizabeth Whitcombe divided pixies into tribes according to personality and deeds . Anna Eliza Bray suggested that pixies and fairies were distinct species . # Modern fiction # Pixies serve as helpers of Santa Claus in L. Frank Baum 's 1902 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' and his 1904 short story ' ' A Kidnapped Santa Claus ' ' . They reside in the Forest of Burzee . In Michael Buckley 's ' ' The Sisters Grimm ' ' series , pixies are described as small orange-glowing creatures that resemble fireflies and are controlled by fairies such as Puck by the use of a small wooden flute . Enid Blyton wrote a number of children 's books with pixies as featured characters . One employee of the BBC even criticised Her stories .. have n't much literary value . There is rather a lot of the Pink-winky-Doodle-doodle Dum-dumm type of name ( and lots of pixies ) in the original tales . In Holly Black 's and Tony Diterlizzi 's Spiderwick Chronicles , pixies are green-skinned , human-sized fairies with shimmering wings . They have a command of glamour ( enchantment ) and a type of power to charm or seduce others . Holly Black has also written a book called ' ' Tithe ' ' in which the main character is a pixie . In Eoin Colfer 's ' ' Artemis Fowl ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species that have been driven underground by humans and the pollution they have caused on Earth . Opal Koboi is the megalomaniac genius pixie of ' ' Artemis Fowl : The Opal Deception ' ' . Colfer describes characteristics of pixies as having abnormally childish features and larger heads than other types of Fairies , with large but vulnerable brains ( their cranial mass is thin , which makes them easy to knock out ) . They are also prone to headaches and , particularly in the case of Opal Koboi , violent mood swings and temper tantrums . Koboi is the perfect example of their genius turned to madness . In Terry Pratchett 's ' ' Discworld ' ' novels ' ' The Wee Free Men ' ' and ' ' A Hat Full of Sky ' ' , a race of kilt-wearing fairies , warriors named the Nac Mac Feegle , call themselves Pictsies . In J. K. Rowling 's ' ' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ' ' , Gilderoy Lockhart releases a cage of Cornish blue pixies into the classroom in an inept effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against the Dark Arts class . Rowling 's version of pixies are about 8 inches tall , electric blue in colour , and are wildly rambunctious tricksters . In Kim Harrison 's Rachel Morgan series , Rachel , a witch , works closely with Jenks , a pixie , to track down the missing , save various creatures , retrieve stolen objects , and defend the defenceless , etc . Jenks , his wife , and large family live in , tend , and protect Rachel 's garden . British rock band Alien Stash Tin included a short novelty song called Bingo The Magic Pixie as a bonus track on their 2007 debut album . Bingo is described as living alone and making mushroom wine which he shares with his friends . ' ' Need ' ' , a series of novels by Carrie Jones , follows a struggle against malicious pixies in an urban fantasy setting . Several characters in the Marvel Comics universe have been called Pixie . Neil Gaiman told tales of pixies in his novel ' ' American Gods ' ' . Ivy , the heroine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Cornish piskey who lives with her clan in an abandoned tin mine . # Animation # In the Disney film , ' ' Peter Pan ' ' , Tinker Bell is described as a pixie , although , in the J.M. Barrie play on which the film is based , she is actually a fairy . In the Disney versions she always uses pixie dust , rather than the fairy dust in the play . In Barrie 's original play , Tinker Bell is traditionally staged just as a flying point of light beamed from offstage . Disney continues to use the terms pixie and fairy interchangeably for Tinker Bell , and associated spin-offs . In ' ' The Fairly OddParents ' ' , the pixies are recurring villains who are dull , wear grey suits , speak in monotone voices , wear pointy caps and , unlike the fairies , treat magic like a business . Instead of wands , they carry cellphones . This is due to them being named after pixels . The Head Pixie ( H.P. for short ) , and the other male pixies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not seen . Pixies also make an appearance in the cartoon Winx Club . In this version , it seems that almost all pixies are females , and while they do use their magic as a carrier based on their talents ( Examples : Chatta for Gossip , Lockette for Portals , Amore for True Love , Tune for Good Manners , Digit for Nano-tech , and Piff for Sweet Dreams ) , these pixies are more colourful , more fun-loving , and more voice-variant in spite of having the same toddler-like , high-pitched accent from their natural toy-like size . Also , the Winx Club pixies are friends with fairies . In fact , each pixie bonds at first sight with her fairy of fate ( like soul mates or twin sisters ) and helps her any way their talent would allow and that fairy , in turn , protects her pixie .
