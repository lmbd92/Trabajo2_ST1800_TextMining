@@6317514 In geometry , a cantellation is an operation in any dimension that bevels a regular polytope at its edges and vertices , creating a new facet in place of each edge and vertex . The operation also applies to regular tilings and honeycombs . This is also rectifying its rectification . This operation ( for polyhedra and tilings ) is also called expansion by Alicia Boole Stott , as imagined by taking the faces of the regular form moving them away from the center and filling in new faces in the gaps for each opened vertex and edge . # Notation # It is represented by an extended Schlfli symbol t <sub> 0,2 </sub> ' ' p ' ' , ' ' q ' ' , ... or <math> rbeginBmatrix p q endBmatrix </math> or rr ' ' p ' ' , ' ' q ' ' , ... . For polyhedra , a cantellation operation offers a direct sequence from a regular polyhedron and its dual .
