' ' lastaired = present Juan Direction is a half-hour weekly documentary-style reality show airing in TV5 Philippines . It aired every Sundays from 10:15 PM to 10:45 PM . The documentary-style reality will airing starting June 23 , 2014 , from Mondays to Fridays , 7:30 PM to 8:00 PM. # Premise # Juan Direction follows five biracial Filipinos explore and learn the Philippines . The name Juan Direction is a play on words of the British boy-band One Direction , unlike 1D , JD does not perform any songs , but instead promotes the Philippines . Juan Direction actually means the Filipino way because Juan is a very common Filipino name , therefore representing Filipinos in general , and Direction because even while they are foreigners ( growing up in different countries ) , they chose to embrace the Filipino culture . The working title for the show during development was Half Filipinos . # History # The boys of Juan Direction got together in 2012 as Island Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel videos on YouTube . Their style is described as a vlogumentary , a mix of vlogging and a documentary , where they have sold buko juice , taho , and balut to name a few , as well as showering with a water pump . Island Media Asia served as a platform to propel them into the television market , and while they still continue to do videos online , JD is sort of an extension of what they did previously , so leaping to another medium was not a difficult transition . While IMA features 7 members and with JD having only 5 of those members , the other 2 ( Matthew Edwards and Keys Cosido ) do have a recurring role , whether they will become permanently part of the cast will become more apparent as the series progresses . Each member hails from different parts of the world , and even those from the same country come from different cities , and it was not until they came to the Philippines that they all met each other . They all met through the modeling industry that formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it became very easy for them to work together on screen . # Production # Before Juan Direction , the boys , as Island Media Asia , originally posted tutorial and documentary-style , and travel videos on YouTube . Juan Direction was one of the shows launched in TV 5 's Everyday All the Way Trade Launch in Taguig on October 2013 , in TV5 Happy Ka Dito in June 2014. # Cast # # Main Cast # * Brian Wilson - Born in Rosario , Cavite , to Filipino mother and a British father .
