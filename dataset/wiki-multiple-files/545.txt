@@2081514 engine = KR : Fichtel &amp; Sachs two-stroke single cylinder Tg500 : 494 cc two-stroke straight-twin engine The Messerschmitt Kabinenroller ( Messerschmitt Cabin Scooter ) was a series of microcars made by Messerschmitt from 1953 to 1956 and by Fahrzeug- und Maschinenbau GmbH , Regensburg ( FMR ) from 1956 to 1964 . All the Messerschmitt and FMR production cars used the Kabinenroller 's monocoque structure , featuring tandem seating and usually a bubble canopy . The Kabinenroller platform was used for three microcars , the three-wheeled Messerschmitt KR175 ( 1953-1955 ) and Messerschmitt KR200 ( 1955-1964 ) , and the four-wheeled FMR Tg500 ( 1957-1961 ) . The platform and all three cars using it were designed by Fritz Fend . # History # The Kabinenroller was designed and developed by Fritz Fend for Messerschmitt AG . Fend had earlier designed and built a series of unpowered and powered invalid carriages , leading up to his Fend Flitzer . Fend noticed that able-bodied people were buying Flitzers for use as personal transport . This led him to believe that a mass-produced two-seat version of the Flitzer would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the project led him to Messerschmitt , who had him develop the project for production in their Regensburg factory . The Kabinenroller was designed and developed for production in 1952 and 1953 . Production of the original version , the KR175 , began in February 1953. 70 modifications had been made to the design by June 1953 . The KR200 was developed on the Kabinenroller platform and replaced the KR175 in 1955 . Based on the same frame and an evolution of the original suspension , the KR200 had a large number of detail changes . On 29-30 August 1955 , a modified KR200 with a tuned engine , revised gear ratios , redundant control cables , a one-off streamlined body , and stock suspension , damping , steering , and brakes , was run at the Hockenheimring for twenty-four hours . During the run , the vehicle set twenty-two closed-circuit speed records for three-wheeled vehicles with displacements up to 250 cc , including the fifty-mile record at 107km/h mph and the twenty-four hour record at 103km/h mph. # Design # # Frame # The Kabinenroller was based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubular steel . The tub tapered upward from front to rear with a bulkhead at the back . The bulkhead supported a tubular steel subframe and acted as the firewall . The subframe supported the engine and the rear suspension . The engine cover was hinged to the monocoque structure . The fuel tank was in the top of the engine cover and fed the carburettor by gravity . The monocoque tub , with the bulkhead at the back , a nose section at the front , and an access hatch system overhead , formed a passenger compartment for a driver and a passenger sitting in tandem . The base plate on which the hatch was hinged was riveted to the right side of the monocoque tub and the nose section . The hatch was made of a steel sheet base with a glass windshield , a plexiglas bubble canopy , and a framed set of sliding windows on either side of the canopy . The tandem seating allowed the body to be long and narrow , with a low frontal area . This also allowed the body to taper like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suspension # Front suspension of the Kabinenroller was by a transverse lower arm sprung by a torsional 3-element rubber spring at the inside end . Front suspension travel was limited by rubber buffers . Rear suspension was by a trailing arm similar to a single-sided motorcycle swingarm which also formed the enclosure for the chain drive to the rear wheel . The trailing arm was suspended by another torsional rubber spring . Hydraulic dampers were added to the design with the introduction of the KR200 in 1955 ; also the front track was increased at that time . # #Steering# # The shaft of the steering control was connected directly to the track rods controlling the front wheels , resulting in approximately one-third of a turn from the left extreme to the right extreme ( lock to lock ) . The handlebar-shaped steering control would be operated with small , controlled inputs .
