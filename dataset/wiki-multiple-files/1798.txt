@@13177514 Peyton M. Magruder ( October 19 , 1911 , Fort Riley , Kansas &amp;ndash ; January 19 , 1982 , Marathon , Florida ) was an aircraft designer best known for his design of the Glenn L. Martin Company 's B-26 Marauder . Magruder was also responsible for the design of the Martin B-10 and the Martin Model 146 ( note , however , both of these attributions seem to be in error because the B-10 's first flight was on February 16 , 1932 when Magruder was only 20 years old and apparently still a midshipman at Annapolis and the Model 146 's first flight was in 1935 - while Magruder did n't join Martin Company until 1937 ) . # Early life # Magruder was born into a military family ; his father was Brigadier General Marshall Magruder . His early life was a succession of moves from one post to another due to his father 's career . This would take him to Manila , Yokohama , Hawaii , and several other posts . Because of his father 's career he had to attend four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Annapolis and West Point . Magruder chose to attend the Naval Academy in Annapolis which he entered in 1930 . He studied less -- and partied more -- than most , but still remained in the upper part of his class . He pole-vaulted for the track team , was a member of the swim team , and once won $350 in bets by running five miles ( 8 km ) in 29 minutes and 37 seconds . He resigned during his senior year of 1934 partially due to a scandal which has now become a part of Naval Academy lore , and partially in order to apply for enlistment in the Army 's aviation school . At that time the Army would not give up slots for Navy officers and cadets because the Navy had its own air school . In order to improve his chances of acceptance Magruder signed up with one of the National Guard 's air units , and enrolled in the Aeronautical Engineering curriculum at the University of Alabama . However , before completion of his one year at Alabama he was engaged to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magruder soon obtained a position at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia , through an encounter with Adm . Ernest J. King , who was then chief of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics . Magruder 's family had been neighbors with King in Newport , Rhode Island while Adm . King and his father studied at the Naval War College . Magruder stayed at the NAF for two years , before moving in 1937 to a job at Glenn L. Martin Company , now Lockheed-Martin. # Design of the B-26 # Glenn L. Martin assigned the then 27-year-old aeronautical engineer the title of Project Engineer , and the task of designing Model 179 according to Army Air Corps specifications issued in January 1939 . This model would later become known as the B-26 Marauder . Design of the Model 179 was completed in June 1939 . On July 5 , 1939 , the Model 179 was submitted to a review board and was rated the highest of those submitted . On August 10 , 1939 , the Army issued a contract for 201 Model 179s under the designation B-26. # Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President for International Chemical Corporation .
