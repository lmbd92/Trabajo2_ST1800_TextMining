The masonry bridge over the now dried-up rivulet of Jaitpur ( the village occupying the site razed by the British in 1912 ) is a reminder of Mughal Emperor Akbar 's interest in the region . By the late 18th century the road marked the edge of the then controversial Shia enclave of Alipur , which contained the remains , houses , and troops of some estranged Persian nobles of the later Mughal court . # Overview # The road marked the edge of the original New Delhi Plan , and still defines the Lutyens Bungalow Zone ( Lutyens ' Delhi ) .

The Meteorological Department was soon followed by the international development community active in Delhi during the 1960s . UNICEF , WHF , and others acquired plots in what was developing into an enclave for the diplomatic and government elite . Subsequently the Chinmaya Mission , World Bank , INTACH and India Habitat Centre ( IHC ) constructed buildings in sympathetic materials and architectural styles .
