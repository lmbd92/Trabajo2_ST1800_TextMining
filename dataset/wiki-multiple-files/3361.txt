@@30938514 Rwanda-Rundi ( Ruanda-Rundi ) is a group of Bantu languages , specifically a dialect continuum , spoken in Central Africa . Neighboring dialects are mutually intelligible , but more distant ones may not be . Two dialects , Kirundi and Kinyarwanda , have been standardized as official languages of Burundi and Rwanda respectively . The other dialects are spoken in Tanzania ; Ha , with one million speakers , is the most important . # Comparison of Kinyarwanda and Kirundi # Kinyarwanda and Kirundi are very similar in many aspects , but differ in several ways as well . # Tonal marking # Both languages are tonal languages . High and low tones ( or H and L ) are the essential tones and , having a phonemic distinction on vowel length , when a long vowel changes from a low tone to a high tone it is marked as a rising tone and when a long vowel changes from a high tone to a low tone , it is marked as a falling tone . This is often illustrated in Kirundi in Meeussen 's Rule . Propositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrical or rhythmic structure . # Spelling # # Word formation # There are many instances in which the two speech varieties of both languages have words that are slightly different . However , these differences do not continually recur . One has to memorize such differences as anga in Kinyarwanda in contrast to -anka in Kirundi ( meaning to dislike or hate ) , because the shift from g to k is extremely rare , with proof being words like inka ( cow ) , inkono ( pot ) and many other words where nk is common in both dialects . Such minor variations involve different consonants , vowels or vowel lengths , tones or affixes.
