It was the Caribs who called the island Karukera , which is roughly translated as island with beautiful waters . They were also the tribe to meet all of the later settlers to the island . Archaeologists suggest that between 800 and 1000 AD drought , desertification and expansion of sand dunes on Guadeloupe led to a period with no active habitation based on the scarcity of remains from the period ; this period coincides historically with the droughts and subsequent collapse of the Mayan civilizations in Mesoamerica . Gradual resettlement and recultivation of the land on Guadeloupe occurred between 1000 AD and the arrival of Columbus . Columbus ' second journey brought him to this island on November 14 , 1493 .

De LOlive waged brutal war against the Caribs in Guadeloupe from 1636 to 1639 , throughout which only 30 to 40 French died . Then in 1640 , reinforcements from St. Christophe of Frenchmen allowed for the colonists to completely crush Carib resistance except for some few who fled to Basse-Terre and would sign a peace treaty with the French colonists in 1641 . Early tobacco cultivation in Guadeloupe through the first half of the 17th century was sustained by relatively small numbers of indentured servants and European laborers under small scale proprietors , and in 1654 80% of the population of Guadeloupe was of European origin , with two-thirds being indentured servants .

In 1714 , the French general government of the American islands divided in two , and Guadeloupe was placed under the control of the governor on Martinique . # Changes in Europe # From 1759 through 1763 , as a part of the Seven Years ' War , the British took control of the island and the main city Pointe--Pitre was established during these years .

The French Revolution unleashed decades of political turmoil , and control of Guadeloupe changed hands a couple of times including 1789 and 1792 . Slavery was abolished by the governor Victor Hugues during this tumultuous time . Guadeloupe experienced the effects of the Reign of Terror from 1794 to 1798 . Meanwhile Louis Delgrs , a mulatto officer , led an uprising in 1802 . He and 800 rebels chose to die rather than submit to the French army . Napoleon reinstated slavery when the French retook the island . The British again held the island for three years beginning in 1810 . It was ceded to Sweden in 1813 after the Napoleonic Wars . However , the Treaty of Paris in 1814 left the island to France again , though the British and Swedish did not fully acknowledge the secession .

A worldwide sugar slump began in 1870 , hurting Guadeloupe 's economy . Sugar was bolstered during the First World War . Guadeloupe was of little international concern between this time . Just after the war , in 1923 , it exported its first bananas . The trial of Henry Sidambarom , Justice of the Peace and defender of the cause of Indian workers , began on 23 February 1904 and ended in April 1923 .
