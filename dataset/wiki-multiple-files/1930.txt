Baker lived in the west London suburb of Bedford Park , and the constrained lives of the lower middle-class clerical classes was the subject of her first performed play ' ' Chains ' ' . She also wrote ' ' The Price of Thomas Cook ' ' , ' ' Miss Tassey ' ' ( 1910 ) and ' ' Miss Robinson ' ' ( 1918 ) . Like other members of the lower middle class intelligentsia , Baker was a lover of books and the theatre , as well as being a vegetarian and a strict teetotaller . After the end of the Great War , she took off with her husband to the Pacific Ocean , living in Rarotonga in the Cook Islands for two years . They followed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another year in New York . After the death of Allaway in 1941 , Baker moved to Bishop 's Stortford in Hertfordshire where she lived with her stepsister in genteel penury . Her luck changed a few years before her death when ITV televised two of her plays - ' ' Chains ' ' was produced as ' ' Ticket for Tomorrow ' ' in November 1959 , and ' ' Miss Robinson ' ' as ' ' Private and Confidential ' ' in May 1960 . The royalties from these eased her financial situation considerably . Baker was reintroduced to a British audience when ' ' Chains ' ' was staged for the first time in nearly a century by the Orange Tree Theatre in November 2007.
