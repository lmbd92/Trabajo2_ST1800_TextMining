Because Longley had no expectation of playing in that game and was completely unprepared , Cowboys lineman Blaine Nye sarcastically called his winning effort the triumph of the uncluttered mind . The game was named the second-best in the history of Texas Stadium by ESPN in 2008 . After a training room incident in which he punched Roger Staubach during the 1976 preseason , the team suspended and eventually traded him to the San Diego Chargers for first and second draft choices , that the Cowboys would eventually use to draft Tony Dorsett. # San Diego Chargers # The San Diego Chargers traded for him with the intention of creating a competition with Dan Fouts , but decided to waive him the following year during the 1977 training camp . # Toronto Argonauts ( CFL ) # He spent part of the 1977 season with the Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Saint Louis Cardinals # The Saint Louis Cardinals signed him in 1978 , but eventually waived him before the season started . # Hamilton Tiger-Cats ( CFL ) # After a year out of football , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats signed him in 1980 , but he could n't make the roster. # Roger Staubach incident # Unfortunately , less than two years after his Thanksgiving Day heroics , Longley , under pressure from Danny White for the back-up QB role , left the Cowboys in disgrace after he landed a blindside punch on Staubach during training camp in Thousand Oaks , California . The infamous sucker punch occurred after Longley and Staubach had fought over a negative remark Longley made about Staubach to fellow Cowboy teammates . Staubach was putting on his shoulder pads on the last day of training camp when Longley hit him in the face without warning and from behind , requiring several stitches to close the wound on Staubach 's face . Longley was immediately traded to the San Diego Chargers where he finished his career with little more success .

' Roger always could bounce the football off the ground to come right back to him , ' Brandt said . ' He 'd do it over and over . They 'd have contests , and Clint could n't do it . ' Longley challenged Roger to a fight . Roger told him they were going to meet on another field after practice . ' Staubach and Longley took off their helmets and pads . ' They got after it , ' Brandt said . ' Roger beat the hell out of him . ' Assistant coach Dan Reeves had to break up the fight . Later , Longley sucker-punched Staubach in the dressing room . ' Tex ( Schramm ) had enough , ' Brandt said . ' He told me to get rid of Longley immediately , so we traded him to San Diego for a first-round pick we used to help us get ( running back ) Tony Dorsett in the next draft .
