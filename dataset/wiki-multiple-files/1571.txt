Having wanted to do so since the age of three , her parents initially managed to stave off her persistence , allowing her piano lessons at the age of 9 . Eighteen months later , having taken well to the piano , she was allowed to have her first harp lesson . Beginning on an Irish instrument called the clarsach ( an instrument that is n't as big as a concert harp and does n't have the pedal mechanism ) , she was taught by a local teacher initially who had to return to her native Czechoslovakia after a year . After this she was taught by Daphne Boden ( who eventually became Thornton 's professor at the Royal Academy of Music ) . Within the year , Boden asked Thornton 's parents if they would buy her a concert harp - a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a Japanese instrument called Ahomaya .

She was also awarded the Mathias Prize for the best performance of his Sante Fe Suite at the International Harp Competition in Cardiff .

Following an audition , she began working with Bryan Ferry , performing on the harp and percussion instruments on his As Time Goes By tour , which comprised a collection of 1930s standards such as the title track . In 2001 she was asked to join the Roxy Music reunion tour - a tour that would involve 50 days of percussion-playing only , and despite her love for the harp , Thornton took this opportunity .
