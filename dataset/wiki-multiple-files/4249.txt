@@41700514 John Sheldon ( 17521808 ) was an English surgeon and anatomist. # Career # Sheldon was born in London on 6 July 1752 , and was apprenticed to Henry Watson , elected in 1766 the first professor of anatomy of the Surgeons ' Company . Sheldon studied and taught anatomy at Watson 's private museum in Tottenham Court Road , which was later wrecked by a mob . He received his diploma at the Surgeons ' Company on 2 November 1775 , and then lectured on anatomy at Great Windmill Street school under William Hunter . Sheldon was surgeon to the General Medical Asylum in Welbeck Street , and on 18 July 1782 he was appointed professor of anatomy to the Royal Academy in succession to Hunter . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 29 April 1784 , and on 20 April 1786 he became surgeon to Westminster Hospital , a post he resigned two years later . # Teacher # In 1777 Sheldon opened a private theatre in Great Queen Street , where he taught anatomy , and pursued research .

He believed that he had discovered an easy method of catching whales with poisoned harpoons , and he made a voyage to Greenland that year to test it . He was sent back on another ship , and from then on was subject to periods of bad mental health , now thought to be a bipolar disorder . Sheldon moved to Exeter . There he was elected surgeon to the Devon and Exeter Hospital on 25 July 1797 . In Exeter Sheldon belonged to the Society of Gentlemen , founded in 1792 by Hugh Downman . Other members included Isaac D'Israeli , Richard Polwhele , and Bartholomew Parr . He contributed to its 1796 volume of essays .

Archibald Geikie in his biography of Barthlemy Faujas de Saint-Fond gives an account which may be garbled , and the Scot James Tytler has priority for British ascents , from August 1784 . Sheldon made a first attempt himself , on 16 August : a tethered balloon caught fire . Vincent Lunardi made the first ascent in England , on 15 September 1784 ; and on 25 September Sheldon again tried with his own Montgolfier balloon from Foley House , Portland Place , London . The balloon caught fire , and Sheldon with his companion Keegan were unable to get off the ground . This attempted ascent was then the subject of a caricature by Paul Sandby . Jean-Pierre Blanchard came to England in the autumn of that year , looking for financial backing for ballooning . Sheldon 's flight with him took place on October 16 . It carried scientific instruments , but failed to ascend : Blanchard threw instruments overboard .

He devoted attention to embalming , too . Both interests came from William Hunter 's inspiration , and were lifelong . Sheldon had a celebrated body of a young woman embalmed : there are differing accounts . It was that of a patient who had died of phthisis in the Lock Hospital , and he embalmed it himself ; it was his mistress , he had William Hunter embalm it , and he kept it in his bedroom until his wife complained . The body was presented by his widow Rebecca ( died 1820 ) to the Royal College of Surgeons . * ' ' The History of the Absorbent System ' ' , London , 1784 ; only the first part was issued , dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks . * ' ' An Essay on the Fracture of the Patella or Kneepan with Observations on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; new edition London , 1819 .
