The village is part of the parish of Appleby Magna , with the vicar based in Appleby . The village has traditionally , and historically , been known as Norton : deriving from the Anglo-Saxon , meaning North-Town ; with variable spellings including Northton and Nortone .

In 1325 several people in Norton were arrested for the murder of Sir William de Monte Gomeri , which took place near to Merevale Abbey . Philippa , widow of the murdered Sir William , said that it was in the manor house at Norton , belonging to Walter de Monte Gomeri ( unclear how they are related ; may have been brother of deceased ) , that Robert de Gresley had sent his brother Peter to kill her husband .

In 1725 Reverend Reuben Clark built a new rectory , but this had fallen into disrepair by 1797 . Reverend William Carsons ' ' ( tenure 1746-1811 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not completed . When The Hon. Alfred Curzon ( son of Nathaniel Curzon , 2nd Baron Scarsdale ) took over the position of rector in 1829 , the house was still unsuitable . Curzon ( who had gained his position through family connections to the local land owner , the Earl Howe ) chose to reside instead in a house near to his birthplace at Kedleston Hall , Derbyshire ( over 27 miles away ) : his duties as priest fulfilled by a curate from the neighboring parish of Appleby Magna . This lack of occupation is probably the cause of the rectory 's ongoing dilapidation , which was confirmed again in 1835 when the Rectory was described as being in a bad and dangerous state . In 1842 the then Rector , Andrew Bloxham , applied to receive Queen Anne 's Bounty in order to repair the rectory . Plans to rebuild were obviously abandoned when in 1850 reverend William Thomas Pearce Mead King constructed a new vicarage to the South-West of the village . The old rectory and outbuildings still remained until at least 1887 , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mead King 's new construction served as the village 's rectory until Norton joined Appleby Magna Parish , at which point it became a private residence , known as Norton Grange . In 1963 Norton Grange and its 12 acre gardens , were purchased for 12,000 by zoologist Molly Badham , who founded Twycross Zoo ( at first known as The East Midlands Zoological Society ) in the rectory 's gardens . Molly and the Zoo are famed for her work training Chimps , most notably for use in the PG Tips Tea Television advertisements which ran from the 1960s to the 1980s. # Population # The Hearth tax reveals there were 16 families living in the village in 1564 and a total of 40 inhabitants were charged the tax in 1664 . In 1829 the parish of Norton is revealed to have had a population of 301 ; with an additional 74 living in an exclave of the parish at Bilston .
