@@13440514 Pariguz ( Serbian : ' ' para ' ' - steam , ' ' guz ' ' - ass ) is a lake in Resnik , an urban neighborhood of Belgrade , Serbia . The funny name of the lake was inherited from the muddy valley which existed before . Creeks filled the valley with water , forming mud which , according to locals , had the power to cure hemorrhoids , so a local with a nude ass was no rare sight by the creek . The lake itself is 700 m long and 120 m wide . This artificial lake was made in 1989 , then dried in 1999 , during the NATO bombing of Serbia ( Urban legends tell that one of the bombs fell in the lake , but never exploded and that was the reason drying and cleaning ; this was never confirmed ) . After that period , the bottom of the lake was cleaned and the lake refilled with water from 4 creeks , which form the Topcider river . Today , the lake is rich with fish and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partridges and other birds . Current plans for making Pariguz part a sport centre with hotels and restaurants on water are dividing the local community , which agrees that some part of the shore should be arranged for the swimmers , but highly disapproves of the disturbance of the local ecosystem , and the peacefulness of its shores , which many locals seek and find in this place . # References # * ' ' The information in this article is based on that in its Serbian equivalent ' ' .
