@@11372514 birthplace = Yang Yuanqing ( , born 1964 ) is the current chief executive officer of Lenovo. # Early life and education # Yang was born on 12 November 1964 to parents both educated as surgeons . He grew up poor as his parents were paid the same salaries as manual laborers . Yang spent his childhood in Hefei in Anhui province . Yang 's parents were repeatedly persecuted during the Cultural Revolution . Yang 's father , Yang Furong , was a disciplined man with strict standards . Yang said of his father , If he set a target , no matter what happened , he wanted to reach it . While his parents wanted him to pursue a career in medicine , and he had a budding interest in literature , Yang decided to study computer science on the advice of a family friend who was a university professor . Yang earned an undergraduate degree in computer science from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1986 and graduated with a master 's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1988. # Lenovo # Yang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beijing performing research for his master 's degree . Yang had initially planned on becoming a university professor but took a risk and accepted a position with Lenovo in sales . He was paid the equivalent of US$30 per month . In 1989 , Yang joined Legend , as Lenovo was then known , at the age of 25 . He was quickly promoted . Yang travelled to meet distributors throughout China and used his technical knowledge to help build an outstanding sales record . Yang also stood out at Lenovo for being a quiet , deep thinker . These qualities caught the attention of Liu Chuanzhi , who later promoted Yang to head Lenovo 's personal computer business at just 29 years old . Yang was elevated to CEO of the whole company when Liu retired in 2001 . Liu described Yang as A man who moves forward , takes risks and aims to innovate . Liu also said , I had been observing Yang a long time before I appointed him to take over the PC business . He had clear goals , was broad-minded and straightforward . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to write a bid to become an IBM reseller . After submitting his bid , Yang discovered that he had quoted twice the price of his competitors . Within a year of joining Lenovo in 1988 , Yang had lost interest in sales and had taken the TOEFL in preparation to study overseas . Yang stayed on after repeated requests from Liu Chuanzhi . Yang believed that he would benefit from exposure to American business practices but Liu persuaded him to delay his plans for two years . Problems at Legend due to lower import duties on personal computers did not allow for this though . Yang was responsible for Lenovo implementing specific job descriptions with clear responsibilities and a system of performance evaluations used to determine annual bonuses . At the time , most Chinese enterprises distributed bonuses of equal size to all employees , there was little sense of responsibility , and workers waited passively for superiors to issue instructions . When Yang took over Lenovo 's personal computer division , he strongly discouraged the use of formal titles and required staff to address each other by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their offices each morning to greet their employees while carrying signs with their first names . When Yang 's division moved to a new building in 1997 , he used the move to break Lenovo 's cultural links to the past by insisting on a more formal dress code and training all employees in telephone etiquette ; Yang wanted his people to think and act like high-tech workers in developed markets . After addressing , human resources issues , Yang moved on to distribution . Due to China 's large territory , large population , varying degrees of economic development , and widely different local regulations , Lenovo was having difficulty operating nationwide . While Lenovo had been using direct sales and a network of distributors , Yang gave up on direct sales in favor of exclusively using independent agents in order to avoid the costs of administering a complex sales network . This action resulted in Lenovo cutting its sales staff from over 100 to just 18 in 1994 . In order to gain the confidence among distributors , Lenovo provided a wide range of products , offered reasonable prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to look out for the interests of distributors . In contrast to Lenovo , foreign firms often tried to squeeze distributors ' margins . Yang made sure that distributors were properly trained and brought in Microsoft and Intel to help with these efforts . Yang also set up a system to monitor the sales , inventory , cash flow , compliance , and pricing of distributors . Many analysts cite Lenovo 's distribution system and after sales service as the key to its expansion . Yang Yuanqing was chairman of Lenovo 's board from 2004 to 2008 . In February 2009 , Yang gave up his position as chairman and again became CEO at Lenovo . In 2005 , Yang Yuanqing began to position Lenovo to become a key ally of Microsoft . Using his substantial influence in China 's technology industry Yang was able to assist Microsoft with fighting piracy of its software . Microsoft had difficulty with this issue for years . A key problem was that most consumers purchased computers with no pre-loaded operating system and later loaded pirated versions of Microsoft 's Windows operating system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for assistance combating piracy . Over the following months Yang worked out a deal with Microsoft China executives . Microsoft agreed to offer a rebate on Windows and marketing assistance in return for preloading it on most Lenovo computers sold in China . Yang was counting on other manufacturers to do the same . Due to government pressure they did so . Microsoft tripled its sales of pre-loaded versions of Windows over the next year . Steve Ballmer said , Yuanqing made a huge difference . He was willing to go out on a limb . Yang also proved to be effective at navigating American politics . In early 2006 , the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo . Critics attempted to smear Lenovo as controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States . Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo . He said , We are not a government-controlled company . He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China 's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment . The State Department deal went through . Yang worried that fears about Lenovo 's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an on-going issue in the United States . Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress . In June of 2006 , Yang arranged to be seated next to C. Richard D'Amato , a member of the congressional committee that had earlier raised concerns about the security of Lenovo 's products . D'Amato later stated that he was impressed with Yang 's candor . The issue soon faded away . While Lenovo 's official language is English , Yang initially did not understand the language well ; he relocated his family to Morrisville in order to improve his language skills and soak up American culture . Yang also hired a private tutor and watched cable news in order to practice . Yang also sent many Lenovo executives to the US for long postings . One American Lenovo executive interviewed by ' ' The Economist ' ' praised Yang for his efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , as of 2013 , Lenovo 's top 14 executives come from seven countries , Lenovo has acquired companies all over the world , and the company has dual headquarters in Beijing and Morrisville , the former home of IBM 's personal computer business . Yang has created a performance culture instead of the traditional Chinese work style of waiting to see what the emperor wants . Yang holds an annual banquet at his home in Beijing for Lenovo 's top executives . Traditionally , each guest at the banquet stands up and uses a toast to set goals for their business unit . Yang has said that when Lenovo enters a new market they intend to be number one . Yang stated , If you do nt have enough scale , if you do nt have enough volume , its hard to make money . If you do nt have enough market share , its hard to make money . Thats why we enter the markets one by one . When we enter a market , we want to quickly get double-digit market share .

According to Lenovo spokesman , Jeffrey Shafer , Yang felt that it would be the right thing to , redirect the money to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done . The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314 . This was almost equivalent to a month 's pay for the typical Lenovo worker in China . Yang contributed another $3.25 million bonus to 10,000 Lenovo employees in 2013 . Employees in 20 countries benefited from Yang 's gift . 85% of recipients were in mainland China . As in 2013 , these workers were generally hourly production staff . Shafer also said that Yang , who owns about eight percent of Lenovo 's stock , felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company . According to Lenovo 's annual report , Yang earned $14 million , including $5.2 million in bonuses , during the fiscal year that ended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011 .
