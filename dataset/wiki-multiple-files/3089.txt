@@27659514 Bat-inspired algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm developed by Xin-She Yang in 2010 . This bat algorithm is based on the echolocation behaviour of microbats with varying pulse rates of emission and loudness. # Algorithm Description # The idealization of the echolocation of microbats can be summarized as follows : Each virtual bat flies randomly with a velocity <math> vi </math> at position ( solution ) <math> xi </math> with a varying frequency or wavelength and loudness <math> Ai </math> . As it searches and finds its prey , it changes frequency , loudness and pulse emission rate <math> r </math> . Search is intensified by a local random walk . Selection of the best continues until certain stop criteria are met . This essentially uses a frequency-tuning technique to control the dynamic behaviour of a swarm of bats , and the balance between exploration and exploitation can be controlled by tuning algorithm-dependent parameters in bat algorithm . A detailed introduction of metaheuristic algorithms including the bat algorithm is given by Yang where a demo program in Matlab/Octave is available , while a comprehensive review is carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of an evolving bat algorithm ( EBA ) with better efficiency .
