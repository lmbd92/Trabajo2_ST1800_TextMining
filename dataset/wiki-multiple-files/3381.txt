@@31093514 The Porticus Catuli ( Portico of Catulus ) was a landmark ( Latin ' ' monumentum ' ' ) on the Palatine Hill in ancient Rome . It was built by Quintus Lutatius Catulus ( consul 102 BC ) to commemorate his joint victory with Gaius Marius over the Cimbri at Vercellae . The portico was adjacent to the house ' ' ( domus ) ' ' of Catulus , which Pliny the Elder regarded as one of the grandest built in the late 2nd century BC . The practice of expanding a family 's ' ' domus ' ' from the relatively modest structures of the mid-Republic began at this time . The Porticus Catuli became known for the display of art works there . Its impressiveness rivaled that of the Temple of Honor and Virtue built by Marius also to commemorate the victory , for which both men earned a triumph . The Porticus Catuli was located on a prominent piece of real estate that had already been highly politicized . It had formerly been the site of the house of M. Fulvius Flaccus , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned to death and had their property confiscated and destroyed . In the mid-1st century BC , the Porticus Catuli was involved in the feud between Cicero and Clodius . When Cicero was condemned to exile for putting Roman citizens to death without allowing them right of appeal , Clodius razed Cicero 's house and perhaps also the Porticus Catuli to build a shrine ' ' ( aedes ) ' ' to Libertas . If the portico was razed rather than incorporated into the new religious complex , it was rebuilt along with Cicero 's house when the orator was restored to Rome .
