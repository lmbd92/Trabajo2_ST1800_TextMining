The attempts of Anna Leopoldovna in making herself a popular regent failed and her Prime Minister Burkhard Christoph von Munnich who had organized the conspiracy against Biron was dismissed because of political and personal differences between both .

Now , certainly , the Tsarina Elisabeth gave her pardon to Biron ; however , because of fear that he could again return to great power such as he had obtained during his old reign , she refused to restore to him his old dignities and the Duchy of Courland . To occupy the new headship of the Duchy , the local knighthood under pressure from Saxony and Poland chose the favorite son of the Polish king Prince Karl Christian in 1758 as their new Duke . The young prince had previously travelled to St. Petersburg from which came the agreement of Tsarina Elisabeth , confirming these plans from their part . # Duke of Courland and Semigallia # Most of Evangelic Courland aristocracy had big doubts about Karl largely because they feared a Roman Catholic Duke would drive back his influence in favor of the Polish-Roman Catholic State and tried to limit Karls means by a contract formulated electoral surrender .

Thereupon Karl who had signed now only a very much generally regarded assurance to religious questions and aristocratic privileges traveled to Courland and , on 29 March 1759 , he solemnly entered the capital of his duchy , Mitau . After the Courland Diet ( ' ' Landtag ' ' ) and the States had met , they lost their hope of wringing a statement from Karl , nevertheless , they still favored him . Appropriately many aristocrats refused to homage the dukes appointment on 3 November 1759 and instead waged protest in Warsaw and St. Petersburg . # Renunciation of the Duchy and later life # When in July 1762 the Tsarina Catherine the Great who had been unapproving of Duke Karl on the basis of his lacking interest in the mental education of his subjects took the Russian throne after a coup d ' tat .

Thereupon Karl lived in Dresden ; however , dedicated himself farther to the hunt in the Annaburger Heath . Karl died in Dresden at age sixty-two . He was buried in the Marienstern Monastery ( Kloster Marienstern ) of Mhlberg. # Secret Marriage and Issue # In Warsaw on 21 March 1760 Karl secretly married Franciszka Corvin-Krasiska , daughter of Count Stanislaus Corvin-Krasiski . Because Franziska did not belong to a ruling dynasty or immediate noble family , the marriage was morganatic .
