@@4279514 Cosmopolitan Bloodloss is the lead single from Glassjaw 's 2002 studio album , ' ' Worship and Tribute ' ' . Two differing versions were released in the US and the UK . As with many Glassjaw songs , Cosmopolitan Bloodloss is lyrically ambiguous and oddly phrased . It mentions a nervous female and someone at an airport addressing most littlest . Aiding the song 's complexity are its many independent layers of guitar which help give it an aggressive and somewhat paranoid feel . # Music video # Both versions of the single contain the Cosmopolitan Bloodloss music video which found marginal airplay on music TV networks . Directed by Patrick Hoelk , it features Vincent Gallo and has the band performing in an alley in New York City . Their loud music awakens Gallo who then begins physically confronting strangers as he walks the streets of New York . He eventually finds the alley the band is performing in , walks up to them , and unplugs their equipment just before the song is finished . He then gives them a long , angry stare as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot for the video in which Gallo walks up to the band , produces a pistol , and shoots each member . It was deemed too violent for TV but can be found online . # Track listing # # US version # # Cosmopolitan Bloodloss &amp;ndash ; 3:04 # Trailer Park Jesus &amp;ndash ; 4:30 # El Mark &amp;ndash ; 3:40 # UK version # # Cosmopolitan Bloodloss &amp;ndash ; 3:04 # El Mark &amp;ndash ; 3:40 # The Number No Good Things Can Come of &amp;ndash ; 5:05
