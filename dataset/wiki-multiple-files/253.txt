@@695514 The Judicature Acts are a series of Acts of Parliament , beginning in the 1870s , which aimed to fuse the hitherto split system of courts in England and Wales . The first two Acts were the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 ( 36 &amp; 37 Vict c. 66 ) and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 ( 38 &amp; 39 Vict c. 77 ) , with a further series of amending acts ( 12 in all by 1899 ) . By the Act of 1873 ( ss. 3 , 4 ) the Court of Chancery , the Court of Queen 's Bench ( known as the King 's Bench when there is a male Sovereign ) , the Court of Common Pleas , the Court of Exchequer , the High Court of Admiralty , the Court of Probate , and the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes were consolidated into the Supreme Court of Judicature , subdivided into two courts : the High Court of Justice ( High Court ) , with ( broadly speaking ) original jurisdiction , and the Court of Appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threefold : *to combine the historically separate courts of common law and equity ; *to establish for all divisions of the new Supreme Court a uniform system of pleading and procedure ; and *to provide for the enforcement of the same rule of law in those cases where equity and common law recognised different rules . The enactment was bold and revolutionary . By one section the Queen 's Bench , the Common Pleas ( in which only serjeants formerly had the right of audience ) , and the Exchequer , and all their jurisdiction , whether criminal , legal , or equitable , were vested in the new court . The fusion of the systems of law and equity was not complete , however , as the Chancery ( equity ) division retained a distinct existence within the new court from the Queen 's Bench ( common law ) division , having a certain range of legal questions under its exclusive control , and possessing to a certain extent a peculiar machinery of its own for carrying its decrees into execution . Nevertheless , all actions could now for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( subject to such special assignments of business as mentioned ) could be tried in any of its divisions . # Common law and equity # The procedure of the common law courts had developed along highly technical and stylised lines . For example , to bring an action in the common law courts a litigant had to file a writ chosen from a set of standard forms . The court would only recognise certain forms of action , and this led to the widespread use of legal fictions , with litigants disguising their claims when they did not fit into a standard recognised form . The emphasis on rigid adherence to established forms led to substantial injustice . On the other hand , the Court of Chancery ( a court of equity ) ran separately and parallel to the common law courts , and emphasised the need to do justice on the basis of the Lord Chancellor 's conscience , softening the blunt instrument of the common law . However , by the nineteenth century proceedings before the Court of Chancery often dragged on and on , with cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem that was parodied by Charles Dickens in the fictional case of ' ' Jarndyce and Jarndyce ' ' in ' ' Bleak House ' ' ) . Also , the practice of the court departed from the original principle of the Lord Chancellor 's conscience , with rules of equity restricting the manner in which the courts of equity would intervene . The existence of these two separate systems led to each party forum shopping , selecting whichever of the two systems would most likely give judgment in his or her favour , and resulting in litigation being tried across both . The solution adopted by the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 was to fuse the administration of the two . Pleadings became more relaxed , with the emphasis shifting from the ' form ' of action to the ' cause ' ( or a set of causes ) of action . Writs for action were filled out for a litigant stating facts , without any necessity of pigeonholing them into specific forms . The same court was now able to apply rules of the common law and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a case required , and depending on what specific area of law the pleadings involved . The result was that , when the issues arising from the causes of action were decided in favour of one party , that party got relief . # Overview # There were originally three common law divisions of the High Court corresponding with the three former courts of common law . However , after the deaths of Lord Chief Baron Kelly ( on 17 September 1880 ) , and Lord Chief Justice Cockburn ( on 10 November 1880 ) , the Common Pleas and Exchequer divisions were consolidated ( by an Order in Council of 10 December 1880 ) with the King 's Bench division into a single division , under the presidency of the Lord Chief Justice of England , to whom , by the Judicature Act 1881 s. 25 , all the statutory jurisdiction of the Chief Baron and the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was transferred . The High Court , therefore , came to consist of the Chancery division , the common law division ( known as the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Admiralty division . To the King 's Bench division was also attached , by an order of the Lord Chancellor dated 1 January 1884 , the business of the London Court of Bankruptcy . The keystone of the structure created by the Judicature Acts was a strong court of appeal . The House of Lords remained the last court of appeal , as before the Acts , but its judicial functions were transferred in practice to an appellate committee , consisting of the lord chancellor and other peers who have held high judicial office , and certain Lords of Appeal in Ordinary created by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 . The High Court and Court of Appeal were formerly referred to as comprising the Supreme Court of Judicature , a concept wholly distinct from the current Supreme Court of the United Kingdom # Pleading # The most important matter dealt with by the rules is the mode of pleading . The authors of the Judicature Act had before them two systems of pleading , both of which were open to criticism . The common law pleadings ( it was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relied , but only the legal aspect of the facts or the inferences from them , while the chancery pleadings were lengthy , tedious and to a large extent irrelevant and useless . There was some exaggeration in both statements . In pursuing the fusion of law and equity which was the dominant legal idea of law reformers of that period , the framers of the first set of rules devised a system which they thought would meet the defects of both systems , and be appropriate for both the common-law and the chancery divisions . In a normal case , the plaintiff delivered his statement of claim , in which he was to set forth concisely the facts on which he relied , and the relief which he asked . The defendant then delivered his statement of defence , in which he was to say whether he admitted or denied the plaintiff 's facts ( every averment not traversed being taken to be admitted ) , and any additional facts and legal defences on which he relied . The plaintiff might then reply , and the defendant rejoin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of pleading was not a bad one if accompanied by the right of either party to demur to his opponent 's pleading , ' ' i.e. ' ' to say , admitting all your averments of fact to be true , you still have no cause of action , or defence ( as the case may be ) . It may be , however , that the authors of the new system were too intent on uniformity when they abolished the common-law pleading , which , shorn of its abuses ( as it had been by the Common Law Procedure Acts ) , was an admirable instrument for defining the issue between the parties though unsuited for the more complicated cases which are tried in chancery , and it might possibly have been better to try the new system in the first instance in the chancery division only . It should be added that the rules contain provisions for actions being tried without pleadings if the defendant does not require a statement of claim , and for the plaintiff in an action of debt obtaining immediate judgment unless the defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of course no pleadings in those matters which by the rules can be disposed of by summons in chambers instead of by ordinary suit as formerly . The judges seem to have been dissatisfied with the effect of their former rules , for in 1883 they issued a fresh set of consolidated rules , which , with subsequent amendments , are those now in force . By these rules a further attempt was made to prune the exuberance of pleading . Concise forms of statement of claim and defence were given in the appendix for adoption by the pleader . It is true that these forms do not display a high standard of excellence in draftsmanship , and it was said that many of them were undoubtedly demurrable , but that was not of much importance . Demurrers were abolished , and instead thereof it was provided that any point of law raised by the pleadings should be disposed of at or after the trial , provided that by consent or order of the court the same might be set down and disposed of before the trial ( Order xxv. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of Lord Davey in 1902 , was a disastrous change . The right of either party to challenge his opponent ' ' in limine , ' ' either where the question between them was purely one of law , or where even the view of the facts taken and alleged by his opponent did not constitute a cause of action or defence , was a most valuable one , and tended to the curtailment of both the delay and the expense of litigation . Any possibility of abuse by frivolous or technical demurrers ( as undoubtedly was formerly the case ) had been met by powers of amendment and the infliction of costs . Many of the most important questions of law had been decided on demurrer both in common law and chancery . Lord Davey considered that demurrer was a useful and satisfactory mode of trying questions in chancery ( on bill and demurrer ) , and it was frequently adopted in preference to a special case , which requires the statement of facts to be agreed to by both parties and was consequently more difficult and expensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for decision of questions at law the trial or subsequently , and a preliminary decision the exception , and such exception dependent on the consent of both parties or an order of the court , is a poor substitute for a demurrer as of right , and it has proved so in practice . The editors of the ' ' Yearly Practice ' ' for 1901 ( Muir Mackenzie , Lushington and Fox ) said ( p. 272 ) : Points of law raised by the pleadings are usually disposed of at the trial or on further considerationafterthe trial of the issues of fact , that is to say , after the delay , worry and expense of a trial of disputed questions of fact which after all may turn out to be unnecessary . The abolition of demurrers has also ( it is believed ) had a prejudicial effect on the standard of legal accuracy and knowledge required in practitioners . Formerly the pleader had the fear of a demurrer before him . Nowadays , he need not stop to think whether his cause of action or defence will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously frivolous or vexatious will do by way of pleading for the purpose of the trial and for getting the opposite party into the box . # Juries # Another change was made by the rules of 1883 , which was regarded by some common law lawyers as revolutionary . Formerly every issue of fact in a common law action , including the amount of damage , had to be decided by the verdict of a jury . The effect of the rules of 1883 , said Lord Lindley , who was a member of the rule committee , was to make trial without a jury the normal mode of trial , except where trial with a jury is ordered under rules 6 or 7a , or may be had without an order under rule 2 . The effect of the rules may be thus summarised : *In the Chancery division no trial by jury unless ordered by the judge . *Generally the judge may order trial without a jury of any cause or issue , which before the Judicature Act might have been so tried without consent of parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scientific or local investigation . *Either party has a right to a jury in actions of slander , libel , false imprisonment , malicious prosecution , seduction or breach of promise of marriage , upon notice without order ; *or in any other action , by order . *Subject as above , actions are to be tried without a jury unless the judge , of his own motion , otherwise orders . # Abandonment # Among the specific changes to procedure that occurred as a result of enactment of the Judicature Acts was one impacting on the matter of abandonment of an action . Such an abandonment involves the discontinuance of proceedings commenced in the High Court , typically emerging because a plaintiff is convinced that he will not succeed in a civil action . Prior to the 1875 Act , considerable latitude was allowed as to the time when a suitor might abandon his action , and yet preserve his right to bring another action on the same suit ( see nonsuit ) ; but since 1875 this right has been considerably curtailed , and a plaintiff who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes to abandon his action , can generally obtain leave so to do only on condition of bringing no further proceedings in the matter . # Other changes # Further steps have been taken with a view to simplification of procedure . By Order xxx . rule i ( as amended in 1897 ) , a summons , called a summons for directions , has to be taken out by a plaintiff immediately after the appearance of the defendant , and upon such summons an order is to be made respecting pleadings , and a number of interlocutory proceedings . To make such an order at that early stage would seem to demand a prescience and intelligent anticipation of future events which can hardly be expected of a master , or even a judge in chambers , except in simple cases , involving a single issue of law or fact which the parties are agreed in presenting to the court . The effect of the rule is that the plaintiff can not deliver his statement of claim , or take any step in the action without the leave of the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plaintiff deliver his . statement of claim , and the rest of the summons stand over , and the practical effect is merely to add a few pounds to the costs . It may be doubted whether , as applied to the majority of actions , the rule does not proceed on wrong lines , and whether it would not be better to leave the parties , who know the exigencies of their case better even than a judge in chambers , to proceed in their own way , subject to stringent provisions for immediate payment of the costs occasioned by unnecessary , vexatious , or dilatory proceedings . The order does not apply to admiralty cases or to proceedings under the order next mentioned . The Supreme Court of Judicature Act ( Ireland ) 1877 followed the same lines as the English Acts : the pre-existing courts were consolidated into a Supreme Court of Judicature , consisting of a High Court of Justice and a Court of Appeal . The Judicature Acts did not affect the Scottish judicial system , but the Appellate Jurisdiction Act included the Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the House of Lords .
