@@3504514 Very Rev. Mutio Vitelleschi , S.J. ( also Muzio , Mutius ) ( December 2 , 1563 - 9 February 1645 ) was the 6th Superior General of the Society of Jesus . He was the son of a noble Roman family . Although he was destined for a general ecclesiastical career , a growing desire to enter the Society of Jesus culminated in his taking private vows to enter the novitiate . His parents opposed this , possibly because of the promise not to seek ecclesiastical office or status that Jesuits make . However he was able to receive permission from Pope Gregory XIII , a strong supporter of the Jesuits , a concession to enter the novitiate against his families will . # Work # Vitelleschi taught logic in 1588-89 , natural philosophy in 1589-90 , and metaphysics in 1590-91 ; later he was professor of theology , then prefect of studies and finally he was elected general of the Society of Jesus in 1615 . His lectures on natural philosophy include ' ' Physics ' ' , ' ' De caelo ' ' , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' . # Early missions in the Society # After entering the novitiate on 15 August 1583 , he taught in the Roman College , and then was appointed rector of the English College , Rome , enjoying two stints ( 15921594 , and 15971598 ) . He was also Provincial of the then Neapolitan Province , and later the Roman Province . Apart from his fame as a good teacher and orator , the only historical details that we have from these times are a sermon that he delivered to Pope Gregory , on Good Friday in 1590 , on the passion of Christ . # Legacy # He is portrayed positively as a minor figure in the fictional 1632 series , also known as the 1632-verse or Ring of Fire series , an alternate history book series , created , primarily co-written , and coordinated by historian Eric Flint # General Congregation VII # # Sources # * WALLACE , William A. , ' ' Galileo 's Early Notebooks : The Physical Questions ' ' ( University of Notre Dame Press , 1977 ) , 18-19.
