' ' In nuclear physics a superdeformed nucleus is a nucleus that is very far from spherical , forming an ellipsoid with axes in ratios of approximately 2:1:1 . Normal deformation is approximately 1.3:1:1 . Only some nuclei can exist in superdeformed states . The first superdeformed states to be observed were the fission isomers , low-spin states of elements in the actinide and lanthanide series . The strong force decays much faster than the Coulomb force , which becomes stronger when nucleons are greater than 2.5 femtometers apart . For this reason , these elements undergo spontaneous fission . In the late 1980s , high-spin superdeformed rotational bands were observed in other regions of the periodic table . Specific elements include ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , silver , osmium , iridium , platinum , gold , and mercury . The existence of superdeformed states occurs because of a combination of macroscopic and microscopic factors , which together lower their energies , and make them stable minima of energy as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described by the liquid drop model . The liquid drop 's energy as a function of deformation is at a minimum for zero deformation , due to the surface tension term . However , the curve may become soft with respect to high deformations because of the Coulomb repulsion ( especially for the fission isomers , which have high Z ) and also , in the case of high-spin states , because of the increased moment of inertia . Modulating this macroscopic behavior , the microscopic shell correction creates certain superdeformed magic numbers that are analogous to the spherical magic numbers . For nuclei near these magic numbers , the shell correction creates a second minimum in the energy as a function of deformation . Even more deformed states ( 3:1 ) are called hyperdeformed.
