@@893514 Saint-Jacques Tower ( Tour Saint-Jacques ) is a monument located in the 4th arrondissement of Paris , France , on Rue de Rivoli at Rue Nicolas Flamel . This 52mft 0 Flamboyant Gothic tower is all that remains of the former 16th-century Church of **29;2709;TOOLONG ( Saint James of the butchery ) , which was leveled shortly after the French Revolution . # A starting point for the ' ' chemin de Compostelle ' ' # The tower 's rich decoration reflects the wealth of its patrons , the wholesale butchers of the nearby Les Halles market . The masons in charge were Jean de Felin , Julien Mnart and Jean de Revier . It was built in 1509 to 1523 , during the reign of King Francis I. With a dedication to Saint James the Great , the ancient church and its landmark tower welcomed pilgrims setting out on the road that led to Tours and headed for the way of St James , which led to the major pilgrimage destination of Santiago de Compostela . A relic of the saint preserved in the church linked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1998 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO among the sites and structures marking the ' ' chemins de Compostelle ' ' , the pilgrimage routes in France that led like tributaries of a great stream headed towards Santiago in the northwest of Spain . # Nineteenth century # The church , with the exception of the tower , was demolished in 1793 ; preservation of the tower was a condition of the contract by which the church was bought for the value of its building materials . In 1824 it was being used as a shot tower to make small shot . It was repurchased by the City of Paris in 1836 and declared a Monument Historique in 1862 . A statue of the saint was installed on the top of the tower during the 19th century . During the Second Empire , the architect Thodore Ballu restored the tower , placing it on a pedestal and designing a small city park around it . This coincided with the construction of the rue de Rivoli and the avenue Victoria nearby , requiring huge quantities of earth to be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pedestal allowed the tower to retain its original elevation : nowadays , the change in ground level can best be appreciated in rue St-Bon , just northeast of the tower , where a staircase leads up to the original street level at rue de la Verrerie . A statue of Blaise Pascal is located at the base of the tower , commemorating the experiments on atmospheric pressure , though it is debated whether they were performed here or at the church of **25;2740;TOOLONG . A meteorological laboratory is also installed at the top of the tower . The tower inspired Alexandre Dumas to write the play ' ' La tour **29;2767;TOOLONG ' ' in 1856 . Nicolas Flamel , a patron of the church , was buried under its floor . # Modern restoration # The tower was surrounded by scaffolding and obscured by sheeting for some years as surveyors investigated the condition of the stone . Recent findings show that most of the stone and its ornamentation originates from the late-medieval era of the tower 's construction , and was not added by the 19th-century restorers . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three quarters of sheeting was taken down in March 2008 , revealing a renovated upper section of the tower . From October 2008 to February 2009 , the scaffolds and sheeting were completely removed and the surrounding park 's landscaping was being restored . Finally , on the 18 April 2009 , the park was re-opened to the public . # Notes #
