@@5935514 Keselo is a small medieval fortress just above the village of Omalo in Tusheti ( historic geographic area in eastern Georgia ) . The site is surrounded by the northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains . It is bordered in the north by Republic of Chechnya and Dagestan , in the east by the Georgian historic provinces Kakheti and Pshav-Khevsureti to the south . The population of the area is mainly ethnic Georgians called Tushs or Tushetians ( ) , However , there are some villages nearby which are populated by Daghestanis. # History # Traditionally Tush peoples abandoned their villages and used towers as temporary shelters during raids on their villages . Keselo was constructed during the Mongol invasion of Georgia in 1230s . It originally had 13 towers . The inhabitants of old Omalo used the towers to protect themselves from the invading Mongols and later raids by Daghestani tribes . By the 20th century , most of the towers were in ruins . However in 2003 , work began to rebuild five towers of the medieval fortress . The project was privately sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia and later by the Keselo Foundation . The restoration was done in accordance with the medieval Tush techniques of constructing fortified towers . A monument was also erected in the nearby village of Dartlo and a tower in Khiso , on the road to Omalo , was also rebuilt . During the work , an array of archaeological artefacts , such as ancient rock art motifs and Bronze Age axes and jewellery , were discovered .
