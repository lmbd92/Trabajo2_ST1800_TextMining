@@12514 In traditional belief and fiction , a ghost ( sometimes known as a spectre ( British English ) or specter ( American English ) , phantom , apparition or spook ) is the soul or spirit of a dead person or animal that can appear , in visible form or other manifestation , to the living . Descriptions of the apparition of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes , to realistic , lifelike visions . The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy , or in spiritism as a ' ' sance ' ' . The belief in manifestations of the spirits of the dead is widespread , dating back to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures . Certain religious practicesfuneral rites , exorcisms , and some practices of spiritualism and ritual magicare specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead . Ghosts are generally described as solitary essences that haunt particular locations , objects , or people they were associated with in life , though stories of phantom armies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also been recounted . The synonym ' ' spook ' ' is a Dutch loanword , akin to Low German ' ' spk ' ' ( of uncertain etymology ) ; it entered the English language via the United States in the 19th century . Alternative words in modern usage include ' ' spectre ' ' ( from Latin ' ' spectrum ' ' ) , the Scottish ' ' wraith ' ' ( of obscure origin ) , ' ' phantom ' ' ( via French ultimately from Greek ' ' phantasma ' ' , compare ' ' fantasy ' ' ) and ' ' apparition ' ' . The term ' ' shade ' ' in classical mythology translates Greek , or Latin ' ' umbra ' ' , in reference to the notion of spirits in the Greek underworld .

An association with the verb ' ' writhe ' ' was the etymology favored by J. R. R. Tolkien .

Bogey or ' ' bogy/bogie ' ' is a term for a ghost , and appears in Scottish poet John Mayne 's ' ' Hallowe'en ' ' in 1780 . A ' ' revenant ' ' is a deceased person returning from the dead to haunt the living , either as a disembodied ghost or alternatively as an animated ( undead ) corpse . Also related is the concept of a fetch , the visible ghost or spirit of a person yet alive . # Typology # # Anthropological context # A notion of the transcendent , supernatural or numinous , usually involving entities like ghosts , demons or deities , is a cultural universal .

Strategies for preventing revenants may either include sacrifice , i.e. , giving the dead food and drink to pacify them , or magical banishment of the deceased to force them not to return . Ritual feeding of the dead is performed in traditions like the Chinese Ghost Festival or the Western All Souls ' Day . Magical banishment of the dead is present in many of the world 's burial customs . The bodies found in many tumuli ( kurgan ) had been ritually bound before burial , and the custom of binding the dead persists , for example , in rural Anatolia . Nineteenth-century anthropologist James Frazer stated in his classic work , ' ' The Golden Bough ' ' , that souls were seen as the creature within that animated the body . # Ghosts and the afterlife # Although the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal , it appears to have been widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body in every feature , even down to clothing the person wore . This is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures , including such works as the ' ' Egyptian Book of the Dead ' ' , which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death , including the style of dress . # Fear of ghosts # While deceased ancestors are universally regarded as venerable , and often imagined as having a continued presence in some sort of afterlife , the spirit of a deceased person which remains present in the material world ( viz. a ghost ) is regarded as an unnatural or undesirable state of affairs and the idea of ghosts or revenants is associated with a reaction of fear . This is universally the case in pre-modern folk cultures , but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern ghost story , Gothic horror , and other horror fiction dealing with the supernatural . # Common attributes # Another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty , airy , or subtle material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person within the person ( the person 's spirit ) , most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person 's breath , which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist . This belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of breath in certain languages , such as the Latin ' ' spiritus ' ' and the Greek ' ' pneuma ' ' , which by analogy became extended to mean the soul . In the Bible , God is depicted as synthesising Adam , as a living soul , from the dust of the Earth and the breath of God . In many traditional accounts , ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance ( vengeful ghosts ) , or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life . The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death . Seeing one 's own ghostly double or fetch is a related omen of death .

Common to many of them is the theme of losing or being betrayed by a husband or fianc . They are often associated with an individual family line or regarded as a harbinger of death similar to a banshee . Legends of ghost ships have existed since the 18th century ; most notable of these is the ' ' Flying Dutchman ' ' . This theme has been used in literature in ' ' The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ' ' by Coleridge . # Locale # A place where ghosts are reported is described as haunted , and often seen as being inhabited by spirits of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property . Supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building 's past such as murder , accidental death , or suicide sometimes in the recent or ancient past . But not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death , or even on violent grounds . Many cultures and religions believe the essence of a being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . Some religious views argue that the ' spirits ' of those who have died have not ' passed over ' and are trapped inside the property where their memories and energy are strong . # History # # Ancient Near East and Egypt # **33;8401;!-- **401;8436;!-- There are many references to ghosts in Mesopotamian religions the religions of Sumer , Babylon , Assyria and other early states in Mesopotamia . Traces of these beliefs survive in the later Abrahamic religions that came to dominate the region . The 5th-century BC play ' ' Oresteia ' ' contains one of the first ghosts to appear in a work of fiction . # #Roman Empire and Late Antiquity# # The ancient Romans believed a ghost could be used to exact revenge on an enemy by scratching a curse on a piece of lead or pottery and placing it into a grave . Plutarch , in the 1st century AD , described the haunting of the baths at Chaeronea by the ghost of a murdered man . The ghosts loud and frightful groans caused the people of the town to seal up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a haunted house from the ancient classical world is given by Pliny the Younger ( c. 50 AD ) . Pliny describes the haunting of a house in Athens by a ghost bound in chains . The hauntings ceased when the ghost 's shackled skeleton was unearthed , and given a proper reburial . The writers Plautus and Lucian also wrote stories about haunted houses . In the New Testament , Jesus has to persuade the Disciples that he is not a ghost following the resurrection , Luke 24:3739 ( some versions of the Bible , such as the KJV and NKJV , use the term spirit ) . In a similar vein , Jesus ' followers at first believe him to be a ghost ( spirit ) when they see him walking on water . One of the first persons to express disbelief in ghosts was Lucian of Samosata in the 2nd century AD . In his tale The Doubter ( circa 150 AD ) he relates how Democritus the learned man from Abdera in Thrace lived in a tomb outside the city gates to prove that cemeteries were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he persisted in his disbelief despite practical jokes perpetrated by some young men of Abdera who dressed up in black robes with skull masks to frighten him . This account by Lucian notes something about the popular classical expectation of how a ghost should look . In the 5th century AD , the Christian priest Constantius of Lyon recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living , and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied. # Middle Ages # Ghosts reported in medieval Europe tended to fall into two categories : the souls of the dead , or demons . The souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose . Demonic ghosts were those which existed only to torment or tempt the living . The living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of Jesus Christ . The soul of a dead person would divulge their mission , while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the Holy Name . Most ghosts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to atone for their transgressions in life . Their penance was generally related to their sin . For example , the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue ; the ghost of another man , who had neglected to leave his cloak to the poor , was condemned to wear the cloak , now heavy as a church tower . These ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering . Other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths . Medieval European ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the Victorian age , and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession . Some were less solid , and could move through walls . Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive , and dressed in tattered gray rags . The vast majority of reported sightings were male . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night in the forest , or in the remains of an Iron Age hillfort , as at Wandlebury , near Cambridge , England . Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights , which vanished when defeated . From the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211 , at the time of the Albigensian Crusade . Gervase of Tilbury , Marshal of Arles , wrote that the image of Guilhem , a boy recently murdered in the forest , appeared in his cousin 's home in Beaucaire , near Avignon . This series of visits lasted all of the summer . Through his cousin , who spoke for him , the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished , until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly , leading to an extended disquisition on theology . The boy narrated the trauma of death and the unhappiness of his fellow souls in Purgatory , and reported that God was most pleased with the ongoing Crusade against the Cathar heretics , launched three years earlier . The time of the Albigensian Crusade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy . Haunted houses are featured in the 9th-century ' ' Arabian Nights ' ' ( such as the tale of ' ' Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad ' ' ) . # European Renaissance to Romanticism # Renaissance magic took a revived interest in the occult , including necromancy . In the era of the Reformation and Counter Reformation , there was frequently a backlash against unwholesome interest in the dark arts , typified by writers such as Thomas Erastus . The Swiss Reformed pastor Ludwig Lavater supplied one of the most frequently reprinted books of the period with his ' ' Of Ghosts and Spirits Walking By Night . ' ' The Child ballad Sweet William 's Ghost ( 1868 ) recounts the story of a ghost returning to his fiance begging her to free him from his promise to marry her . He can not marry her because he is dead but her refusal would mean his damnation . This reflects a popular British belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new love without some formal release . The Unquiet Grave expresses a belief even more widespread , found in various locations over Europe : ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living , whose mourning interferes with the dead 's peaceful rest . In many folktales from around the world , the hero arranges for the burial of a dead man . Soon after , he gains a companion who aids him and , in the end , the hero 's companion reveals that he is in fact the dead man . Instances of this include the Italian fairy tale Fair Brow and the Swedish The Bird ' Grip ' . # Modern period of western culture # # #Spiritualist movement# # ----- EDITORIAL NOTE ----- -- **379;8839;!-- Spiritualism is a monotheistic belief system or religion , postulating a belief in God , but with a distinguishing feature of belief that spirits of the dead residing in the spirit world can be contacted by mediums , who can then provide information about the afterlife . By 1897 , it was said to have more than eight million followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle and upper classes , while the corresponding movement in continental Europe and Latin America is known as Spiritism . The religion flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization , attaining cohesion by periodicals , tours by trance lecturers , camp meetings , and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums . Many prominent Spiritualists were women . Most followers supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women 's suffrage . By the late 1880s , credibility of the informal movement weakened , due to accusations of fraud among mediums , and formal Spiritualist organizations began to appear . Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational Spiritualist Churches in the United States and United Kingdom . # #Spiritism# # ---- EDITORIAL NOTE ---- -- **376;9220;!-- Spiritism , or French spiritualism , is based on the five books of the Spiritist Codification written by French educator Hypolite Lon Denizard Rivail under the pseudonym Allan Kardec reporting sances in which he observed a series of phenomena that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence ( spirits ) . His assumption of spirit communication was validated by many contemporaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studied the phenomena . His work was later extended by writers like Leon Denis , Arthur Conan Doyle , Camille Flammarion , Ernesto Bozzano , Chico Xavier , Divaldo Pereira Franco , Waldo Vieira , Johannes Greber and others . Spiritism has adherents in many countries throughout the world , including Spain , United States , Canada , Japan , Germany , France , England , Argentina , Portugal and especially Brazil , which has the largest proportion and greatest number of followers . # Scientific view # The physician John Ferriar wrote ' ' An essay towards a theory of apparitions ' ' in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of ghosts were the result of optical illusions . Later the French physician Alexandre Jacques Franois Brire de Boismont published ' ' On Hallucinations : Or , the Rational History of Apparitions , Dreams , Ecstasy , Magnetism , and Somnambulism ' ' in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of hallucinations . David Turner , a retired physical chemist , suggested that ball lightning could cause inanimate objects to move erratically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was no credible scientific evidence that any location was inhabited by spirits of the dead . According to research in anomalistic psychology visions of ghosts may arise from hypnagogic hallucinations ( waking dreams which are experienced in the transitional states to and from sleep ) . In a study of two experiments into alleged hauntings ( Wiseman ' ' et al ' ' . 2003 ) came to the conclusion that people consistently report unusual experiences in haunted areas because of environmental factors , which may differ across locations . Some of these factors included the variance of local magnetic fields , size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware . Some researchers , such as Michael Persinger of Laurentian University , Canada , have speculated that changes in geomagnetic fields ( created , e.g. , by tectonic stresses in the Earth 's crust or solar activity ) could stimulate the brain 's temporal lobes and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings . Sound is thought to be another cause of supposed sightings . Richard Lord and Richard Wiseman have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a room , such as anxiety , extreme sorrow , a feeling of being watched , or even the chills . Carbon monoxide poisoning , which can cause changes in perception of the visual and auditory systems , was speculated upon as a possible explanation for haunted houses as early as 1921. # By religion # # Judo-Christian # The Hebrew Torah and the Bible contain a few references to ghosts , associating spiritism with forbidden occult activities . The most notable reference is in the First Book of Samuel , in which a disguised King Saul has the Witch of Endor summon the spirit/ghost of Samuel . In the New Testament , Jesus has to persuade the Disciples that He is not a ghost following the resurrection , Luke 24:3739 ( some versions of the Bible , such as the KJV and NKJV , use the term spirit ) . Similarly , Jesus ' followers at first believe Him to be a ghost ( spirit ) when they see him walking on water . Most of the Christian Church Some ghosts are actually said to be demons in disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timothy 4:1 , that they come to deceive people and draw them away from God and into bondage . As a result , attempts to contact the dead may lead to unwanted contact with a demon or an unclean spirit , as was said to occur in the case of Robbie Mannheim , a fourteen-year-old Maryland youth . The Seventh-Day Adventist view is that a soul is not equivalent to spirit or ghost ( depending on the Bible version ) , and that save for the Holy Spirit , all spirits/ghosts are demons in disguise . Furthermore , they teach that in accordance with ( Genesis 2:7 , Ecclesiastes 12:7 ) , there are only two components to a soul , neither of which survives death - with each returning to its respective source . Christadelphians reject the view of a living , conscious soul after death .

In Scandinavian and Finnish tradition , ghosts appear in corporeal form and their supernatural nature is given away by behavior rather than appearance . In fact , in many stories they are first mistaken for the living . They may be mute , appear and disappear suddenly , or leave no footprints or other traces . British folklore is particularly notable for its numerous haunted locations . Belief in the soul and an afterlife remained near universal until the emergence of atheism in the 18th century . In the 19th century , spiritism resurrected belief in ghosts as the object of systematic inquiry , and popular opinion in Western culture remains divided . # South and Southeast Asia # # #India# # -- **378;9598;!-- A ' ' bhoot ' ' or ' ' bhut ' ' ( , , or ) is a supernatural creature , usually the ghost of a deceased person , in the popular culture , literature and some ancient texts of the Indian subcontinent .

This could be a violent death , unsettled matters in their lives , or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals . In Central and Northern India , ' ' Aojha ' ' spirit guides play a central role . It duly happens when in the night someone sleeps and decorates something on the wall and they say that if one sees the spirit the next thing in the morning he will become a spirit to and that to a skondho kata which means a spirit without a head and the soul of the body will remain the dark with the dark lord from the spirits who reside in the body of every human in Central and Northern India .

There are also many references to Ghosts in Filipino culture , ranging from ancient legendary creatures such as the Manananggal and Tiyanak to more modern urban legends and horror films . The beliefs , legends and stories are as diverse as the people of the Philippines . There was widespread belief in ghosts in Polynesian culture , some of which persists today . After death , a person 's ghost normally traveled to the sky world or the underworld , but some could stay on earth .

The ghost story is ubiquitous across all cultures from oral folktales to works of literature . # Renaissance to Romanticism ( 1500 to 1840 ) # One of the more recognizable ghosts in English literature is the shade of Hamlet 's murdered father in Shakespeares ' ' The Tragical History of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark ' ' . In ' ' Hamlet ' ' , it is the ghost who demands that Prince Hamlet investigate his murder most foul and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle , King Claudius . In Shakespeares ' ' Macbeth ' ' , the murdered Banquo returns as a ghost to the dismay of the title character . In English Renaissance theater , ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor , as with the ghost of Hamlets father . Armor , being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance , gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity . But the sheeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness : it clanked and creaked , and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators .

Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass , in ' ' Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory ' ' , point out , In fact , it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of ' spirit drapery ' . An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that Ghosts figured prominently in traditional British ballads of the 16th and 17th centuries , particularly the Border Ballads of the turbulent border country between England and Scotland . Ballads of this type include ' ' The Unquiet Grave ' ' , ' ' The Wife of Usher 's Well ' ' , and ' ' Sweet William 's Ghost ' ' , which feature the recurring theme of returning dead lovers or children .

One of the key early appearances by ghosts in a gothic tale was ' ' The Castle of Otranto ' ' by Horace Walpole in 1764 . Washington Irving 's short story ' ' The Legend of Sleepy Hollow ' ' ( 1820 ) , based on an earlier German folktale , features a Headless Horseman . It has been adapted for film and television many times , such as ' ' Sleepy Hollow ' ' , a successful 1999 feature film . # Victorian/Edwardian ( 1840 to 1920 ) # The classic ghost story arose during the Victorian period , and included authors such as M.

With the advent of motion pictures and television , screen depictions of ghosts became common , and spanned a variety of genres ; the works of Shakespeare , Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions .
