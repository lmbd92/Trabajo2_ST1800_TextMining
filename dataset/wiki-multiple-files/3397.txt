@@31191514 The West Virginia Rosie the Riveter Project is an on-going effort created by Thanks ! Plain and Simple , Inc . ( Thanks ! ) , a nonprofit organization founded in 2005 . Thanks developed the project to involve women who worked throughout America during World War II on mens jobs ( most notably riveting airplanes and welding ships , but including a broad range of defense industry employment ) , which was critical to shortening and winning World War II . Thanks ! conducts interviews of these Rosie the Riveters , now 8595 years old , to archive in libraries , but more - the project provides opportunities for Rosies themselves to participate in the decision making of teaching their own legacy . The methods and tangible tools Thanks ! has created help American communities find and learn from their Rosies. # Overview # Thanks ! interviewed the first woman in the WV Rosie the Riveter Project in 2008 .
