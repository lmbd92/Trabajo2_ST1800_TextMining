@@17641514 area=0.12 hectares Lower Dicker is a 0.12 hectare ( 0.23 acre ) geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in East Sussex , England . The site was notified in 1998 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 . The site is a small , overgrown quarry approximately four kilometres north-west of Hailsham . # Geology # Exposures of a sand member are present in the quarry . The sand is of the lower division of the Weald Clay . The sandstone units of the Weald Clay Group represent river deposits which periodically extended into the Wealden lake or lagoon . The sandstones are important as lithostratigraphical markers ( units of rock with the same affinity ) and are considered to reflect the effects of tectonic uplift in nearby areas feeding sediment into the area . The mineralogy of these sandstones reflects their provenance and they are therefore of great importance for understanding the changes which took place in the palaeogeography of the Weald . Upper Dicker provides the most southerly exposure of any of the Weald Clay sand members in Britain . It is also important for marking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today Devon and Cornwall ) debris ( pieces of rock incorporated into the sandstones and clays ) , indicating the presence of a river system extending out of south-west England at this time .
