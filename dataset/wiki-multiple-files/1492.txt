Roger Ebert of the ' ' Chicago Sun-Times ' ' found it too easy to anticipate most of the big moments and too hard to believe that Sheedy was really a spoiled , mean-spirited rich bitch . But Janet Maslin in the ' ' New York Times ' ' praised Sheedy , saying her petulant manner and her air of faint distaste for her surroundings are just right for this role . And she shows herself to be an able physical comedienne. # Filming Locations # Jessie 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles , California .
