@@3059514 The law of truly large numbers , attributed to Persi Diaconis and Frederick Mosteller , states that with a sample size large enough , any outrageous thing is likely to happen . Because we never find it notable when likely events occur , we highlight unlikely events and notice them more . The law seeks to debunk one element of supposed supernatural phenomenology. # Example # For a simplified example of the law , assume that a given event happens with a probability of 0.1% in one trial . Then the probability that this unlikely event does ' ' not ' ' happen in a single trial is 99.9% = 0.999 . In a sample of 1000 independent trials , the probability that the event does not happen in any of them is <math> 0.9991000 </math> , or 36.8% . The probability that the event happens at least once in 1000 trials is then 1 &amp;minus ; 0.368 = 0.632 or 63.2% . The probability that it happens at least once in 10,000 trials is <math> 1 - 0.99910000 = 0.99995 = 99.995 % </math> . This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening if 1000 chances are given , or over 99.9% for 10,000 chances . In other words , a highly unlikely event , given enough tries , is even more likely to occur . # In criticism of pseudoscience # The law comes up in criticism of pseudoscience and is sometimes called the Jeane Dixon effect ( see also Postdiction ) . It holds that the more predictions a psychic makes , the better the odds that one of them will hit . Thus , if one comes true , the psychic expects us to forget the vast majority that did not happen . Humans can be susceptible to this fallacy . A similar manifestation can be found in gambling , where gamblers tend to remember their wins and forget their losses and thus hold an inflated view of their real winnings . Steven Novella describes this as the lottery fallacy : # It is also the lottery fallacy . If we hold a world-wide lottery and only one human in the 6.5 billion wins , the odds of that person winning is very small . But someone had to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have won by chance alone , because the odds were against it . #
