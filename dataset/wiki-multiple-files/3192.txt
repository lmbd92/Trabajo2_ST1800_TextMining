@@28771514 The Battle of the Dalmatian Channels was a three-day confrontation between three tactical groups of Yugoslav Navy ships and coastal artillery , and a detachment of naval commandos of the Croatian Navy fought on 1416 November 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence . On 14 November , the commandos torpedoed a ' ' Mirna ' ' -class patrol boat P-176 ' ' Mukos ' ' close to the island of Bra in the Split Channel of the Adriatic Sea , prompting a Yugoslav naval bombardment of Bra and olta Island the same day . The drifting ' ' Mukos ' ' was salvaged by Croatian civilian boats and was beached at Neujam bay . The next day , a group of Yugoslav Navy vessels deployed to the Split Channel , organised into the Katela tactical group ( TG ) and bombarded the city of Split in retaliation for the loss of ' ' Mukos ' ' . In return , Croatian coastal artillery engaged the Katela TG .

On 16 November , the combined Yugoslav force sailed through the Korula Channel a strait separating the islands of Hvar and Korula to reach safety at the Yugoslav Navy base at Vis . The warships were then engaged by Croatian coastal artillery deployed on Korula and the Peljeac Peninsula , losing two minesweepers to the artillery fire in the process . The battle marked the last deployment of the Yugoslav Navy into one of the Dalmatian channels , the loosening of the naval blockade of the Croatian coast imposed in September and the largest Croatian Navy operation in the war . The Croatian Navy later towed the grounded ' ' Mukos ' ' to ibenik , repaired the vessel and put her into service as OB-62 ' ' olta ' ' .

In response to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of olta and Bra , the Vis TG led by ' ' Pula ' ' sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Katela TG .
