@@602514 Eysteinn ( Swedish : sten ; died ca 600 ) was the son of Eadgils and Yrsa of Saxony . He was the father of Ingvar . The Eysteinn tumulus ' ' ( stens hg ) ' ' in Vsters near stanbro has been linked to King Eysteinn by some popular historians . The term Hg is derived from the Old Norse word ' ' haugr ' ' meaning mound or barrow . Snorri Sturluson relates that Eysteinn ruled Sweden at the time when Hrlf Kraki died in Lejre . It was a troubled time when many sea kings ravaged the Swedish shores . One of those kings was named Slve and he was from Jutland ( but according to ' ' Historia Norwegiae ' ' he was Geatish , see below ) . At this time Slve was pillaging in the Baltic Sea and so he arrived in Lofond ( probably the island of Lovn or the Lagunda Hundred ) , where Eysteinn was at a feast . It was night-time and Slve and his men surrounded the house and set it on fire burning everyone inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sigtuna ) and ordered the Swedes to accept him as king . The Swedes refused and gathered an army that fought against Slve and his men , but they lost after eleven days . The Swedes had to accept him as king for a while until they rebelled and killed him . Snorri then quotes a stanza from jlfr of Hvinir 's ' ' Ynglingatal ' ' : : Veit ek Eysteins : enda flginn : lokins lfs : Lofundi ; : ok sikling : me Svum kvu : Jtska menn : inni brenna . : Ok bitstt : brandni : hlar angs : hilmi rann , : er timbrfastr : toptar nkkvi , : flotna fullr : um fylki brann . : For a long time none could tell : How Eystein died but now I know : That at Lofond the hero fell ; : The branch of Odin was laid low , : Was burnt by Solve 's Jutland men . : The raging tree-devourer fire : Rushed on the monarch in its ire ; : First fell the castle timbers , then : The roof-beams Eystein 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents a Latin summary of ' ' Ynglingatal ' ' , older than Snorri 's quotation ( continuing after Eadgils , called ' ' Adils or Athisl ' ' ) : Hic Adils vel Athisl genuit Eustein , quem Gautones in domo quadam obtrusum cum suis vivum incenderunt . Hujus filius Ynguar ... . He Adils became sire to ystein , whom the Gtar thrust into a house and incinerated alive there with his men . His son Yngvar , ... ' ' Thorsteins saga Vkingssonar ' ' makes Eysteinn the father of Anund and grandfather of Ingjald and consequently skips Ingvar 's generation . It adds a second son to Eysteinn named Olaf , who was the king of Fjordane in Norway . # Notes # # Primary sources # *Ynglingatal *Ynglinga saga ( part of the Heimskringla ) *Historia Norwegiae *Thorsteins saga Vkingssonar # Secondary sources # Nerman , B.
