@@2202514 ' ' The Byrds ' Greatest Hits ' ' is the first greatest hits album by the American rock band The Byrds and was released in August 1967 on Columbia Records ( ' ' see ' ' 1967 in music ) . It is the top-selling album in The Byrds ' catalogue and reached #6 on the ' ' Billboard ' ' Top LPs chart but failed to break into the UK Albums Chart . The album provides a summary of The Byrds ' history during Gene Clark and David Crosby 's tenure with the band and also functions as a survey of the group 's hit singles from 1965 to 1967 , a period when the band had its greatest amount of success on the singles chart . Most of the band 's U.S. A-sides from this period are included on the album , along with three of their more important album tracks : I 'll Feel a Whole Lot Better , The Bells of Rhymney , and Chimes of Freedom . The three U.S. singles from this period that are not included on the album are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face and Lady Friend ( although these songs have been included as bonus tracks on various CD reissues of the album ) . All of the songs included on the original ' ' Greatest Hits ' ' album can also be found on the band 's first four albums , ' ' Mr. Tambourine Man ' ' , ' ' Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! ' ' , ' ' Fifth Dimension ' ' and ' ' Younger Than Yesterday ' ' . The eight tracks on ' ' The Byrds ' Greatest Hits ' ' that had been singles peaked at the following positions on the ' ' Billboard ' ' Hot 100 : 5D ( Fifth Dimension ) #44 ; All I Really Want to Do #40 ; Mr. Spaceman #36 ; My Back Pages #30 ; So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star #29 ; Eight Miles High #14 ; Turn !

Turn ! #26 ; Eight Miles High #24 ; All I Really Want to Do #4 ; and Mr. Tambourine Man #1 . In particular , the Eight Miles High , Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! , and Mr. Tambourine Man singles were widely influential during the 1960s , a time when singles , at least in pop music , were as important in their own right as albums , and generally more so . Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! summed up the decade 's counter-cultural values as much as Blowin ' in the Wind , ( I Ca n't Get No ) Satisfaction or All You Need Is Love , while Mr. Tambourine Man and Eight Miles High helped to introduce the subgenres of folk rock and psychedelic rock respectively into the popular music of the day . # Release # ' ' The Byrds ' Greatest Hits ' ' was released on August 7 , 1967 in the United States ( catalogue item CL 2716 in mono , CS 9516 in stereo ) and October 20 , 1967 in the United Kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stereo ) .

Paul Williams enthusiastically waxed lyrical about the album in a review published in ' ' Crawdaddy ! ' ' magazine : Any greatest hits album is insignificant . By definition it contains nothing unfamiliar ; and yet this very fact offers great potential beauty , for a well-made greatest hits LP might then unleash the emotion of familiarity in an artistic context . The Byrds have achieved that goal : always masters of the form , they have now taken the concept of a great hits anthology and created from it an essay into rediscovery . ' ' WCFL Beat ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that during the mid-1960s British Invasion The Byrds were the only American band to help to revolutionize the pop scene and to pave the way for the so-called psychedelic music of today . In the UK , ' ' Record Mirror ' ' gave the album a top rating of 4 stars , while commenting This is a chronological collection of their singles and is really something . Their sound has progressed from the Dylanesque to the sound which is one of the best in the pop world . A November 1967 review of the album in ' ' Beat Instrumental ' ' declared This is probably the best collection LP to come out of the states this year , and has songs that wo n't date for years to come . In recent years , Stephen Thomas Erlewine , in his review for the Allmusic website , has described the album as pretty close to a definitive single-disc summary of the Byrds ' prime . Sarah Zupko also praised the album in her PopMatters review , noting that The Byrds perfectly captured the mood of their time . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Music Tap website , Robert Olsen described the album as a compilation album featuring some of the better known recordings from the first 4 albums . Olsen went on to note that The first album is over-represented , and there 's an unwholesome emphasis on the Dylan cuts . Nevertheless , at the time the album was stunning in its breadth and provided the next generation with a good sample of the sound and direction of the group . In 2003 , the album was ranked at #178 on ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' magazine 's list of the ' ' The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time ' ' , although it was dropped when the list when was updated in 2012. # Track listing # # Side 1 # # Mr. Tambourine Man ( Bob Dylan ) 2:29 # I 'll Feel a Whole Lot Better ( Gene Clark ) 2:32 # The Bells of Rhymney ( Idris Davies , Pete Seeger ) 3:30 # Turn !
