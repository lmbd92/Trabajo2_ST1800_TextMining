@@204514 Little London is a village situated between the North Hampshire Downs and the gravel plains of the Kennet valley , north of Basingstoke and south of Reading . It is situated within Pamber civil parish and backs on to Pamber Forest , a 500acre km2 SSSI and remnant of the much larger ancient Royal Forest of Pamber . It is recorded as having been established for at least 400 years . # History # Until the mid 19th century the village was a local centre for brick-making , the local clays being recognised as particularly good since the Roman period . Examples of clay roof tiles produced in this area for the nearby Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum ( near modern Silchester ) can be seen at Reading Museum . A major part of the village was confiscated from the Engelfield family and given to the Benyon family during the late Tudor period . Other parts were gifted in payment to The Queen 's College , Oxford . It is assumed that this was in return for education , although it may not have been .

Current local planning policy has successfully prevented any inappropriate development of additional housing in the area . Current population is of only a few hundred .

The village has one Pub , The Plough , which maintains a very traditional ' English Pub ' environment . ' Little London ' is a common village name in England , assumed by some to have its origins in the quantity of seasonal Londoners who would camp for the harvest season . However in common with many ' Little Londons ' approximately 50 mi or so from London , it has also been claimed that the name was given by settlers escaping the Great Plague of London of 1665 . Alternatively , it could have been corrupted from ' Little Loddon ' , the name of a stream that marks the Southern extent of the village .

Tadley was on the route to the fairs of Blackbush , Farnham , Croydon and Kingston , and London 's Smithfield market . The sites were established on common land away from other communities . The drovers had a licence to travel , granted by Elizabeth 1st , and were regarded as foreigners by the local parishioners who could not travel without a settlement certificate . # Governance # The village of Little London is part of the civil parish of Pamber , which covers Pamber Heath , Pamber End , Pamber Green and Little London and meets in Pamber Heath Memorial Hall and St. Stephens Hall , Little London .
