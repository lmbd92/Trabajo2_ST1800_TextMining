@@25396514 # Genre # Tales of Heich ( ' Heich monogatari ' ) belongs to the genre of uta monogatari poem tales that emerged in Japanese literature from the mid 10th to the early 11th centuries . As early as the Collection of Ten-Thousand Leaves ( Manysh ) , a poetry collection completed around 759 , there appeared poems introduced by brief prose narrations . The imperial court began to come alive with poetry from around this time . People exchanged poetry with one another on topics as diverse as love and politics and religion . Towards the end of the 9th century it was common for individual poets to keep compilations of their own verse , sometimes explaining in prose the circumstances behind a poem 's composition . The highest honor was to have ones poem selected for inclusion in the Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry ( Kokinsh ) , the first imperial poetry collection , which was completed around 905 . By the middle of the 10th century the idea of a poem paired with a prose narration seems to have taken hold , and Tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tales of Yamato ( Yamato monogatari ) seem to have emerged at about this same time . Also , the second imperial poetry collection , Collection of Later Poetry ( Gosensh ) , commissioned in 951 and compiled shortly thereafter , has many narrative qualities . The only extant manuscript of Tales of Heich is a 61-page codex discovered in 1931 that seems to date from the Kamakura Period ( 11851333 ) , some three hundred years after the work 's probable date of composition . # Author # The author of Tales of Heich could have been Taira no Sadafun , whose name appears variously as Sadafun , Sadabun , Sadafumi , and Sadabumi ( 870 ? -923 ? ) , but more likely it was compiled by someone else after his death on the basis of a non extant personal poetry collection compiled by Sadafun himself and popular legends developing after his death . With nine poems by Sadafun in the Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry , he ranks fourteenth out of the 120 poets whose work appears in the only imperial anthology compiled during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , is the first narrative work to equate the names Sadafun and Heich . It has been traditionally assumed that the stories about Heich were based on episodes in the life of the historical person Taira no Sadafun , but modern scholarship has never been able to prove this . Tales of Heich may have reflected the real Sadafun , but clearly the intent of the work was not simply biographical . Indeed , it may have been wholly fictional or based merely on hazy memories of an historical personage already deceased . In the stories Heich is a courtier of imperial blood whose family has known better days . Though only of middling rank in the government bureaucracy , however , he was recognized in his own time as a sensitive poet of some talent . # Heich Legend # By the mid tenth century , soon after Sadafun 's death , his amatory escapades began to appear in Tales of Ise , Tales of Heich , and Tales of Yamato . These stories continued to be told with changes and additions over the next 1000 years , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Different authors focused on the characteristics of the hero that interested them most , whether sensitive poet or spurned lover . Later the amatory ideal turns into a profligate rake and then a ridiculous clown . Sometimes his portrayed immorality became the basis for a lecture or sermon illustrating some moral issue . He became the object of historical researches , and eventually appeared in a pornographic tale or two . Heich provided a fluid and varied image as different authors used him to further their own moral and narrative ends . Within the first fifty years of the legend 's formation there appeared three of the four stock stories associated with Heich : The ' mitsu ' I have seen it ! story , which is the germ of the more elaborate story of Hon'in Jij that emerges fully developed nearly two centuries later in Tales of Times Now Past ; Fragments of the story of Kunitsune 's wife whose kidnapping later become the basis for more detailed narrations involving Heich and Fujiwara no Tokihira ; The story of Musashi , the maiden who takes the tonsure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single night of love-making . Another 50 years later there emerges the fourth major story of the Heich legend : The ' suminuri ' ink-blackening story in which Heich inadvertently blackens his face with tears of ink . Clearly by the end of the tenth century readers were beginning to laugh at the excesses of Heich , who had once been appreciated as a lover of refined sensibility and elegant poems .
