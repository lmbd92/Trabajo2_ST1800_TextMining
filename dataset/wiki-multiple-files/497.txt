@@1862514 Saintes ( ) , is a commune located in southwestern France , in Poitou-Charente and Charente-Maritime department of which it is a sub-prefecture . Its inhabitants are called ' ' Saintaises ' ' and ' ' Saintais ' ' . Saintes is the second largest city in Charente-Maritime , with inhabitants in 2008 ; and it has the second largest metropolitan area in the department , with inhabitants . In Roman times , Saintes was known as ' ' Mediolanum Santonum ' ' , and during much of its history , the name of the city was spelled Xaintes and Xainctes . Primarily built on the left bank of the river Charente , Saintes became the first Roman capital of Aquitaine , and later , the capital of the province of Saintonge under the Ancien Rgime . Following the French Revolution , it briefly became the prefecture of the department ( then called ' ' Charente-Infrieure ' ' ) during the territorial reorganization of 1790 , until La Rochelle took its place in 1810 . Even though it was but a subprefecture , **15;0;ref The prefecture of Charente-Maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonzac , Rochefort , Saint-Jean-d'Angly and Saintes . Saintes was allowed to remain the center of the judiciary life in the department . In the last third of the 19th century , Saintes was chosen as the seat of the VIIIth ' ' arrondissement ' ' of the Chemins de Fer de l ' tat , which enabled an era of economic and demographic growth . Today , Saintes remains the economic heart of the center of the department and it is an important transportation hub . Its industry counts but a few companies ( electronics industry , rail repair , construction of hoists ) , but the city is an important commercial ( with the seat of Coop Atlantique ) and tertiary center ( administrative functions of state , criminal court and judicial activities , banks , schools , hospital ) . Because of its noteworthy Gallo-Roman , medieval and classical heritage , Saintes is a popular touristic destination , member of the French Towns and Lands of Art and History since 1990 . It has several museums , a theater , cinemas , and organizes numerous festivals .

The city is located 60 km southeast of La Rochelle , 33 kilometers northeast of Royan ( to which it is linked by the A10 autoroute ) . # Geology # A chronostratigraphic stage has been named after Saintes , or more exactly after its ancient inhabitants , the Santones : the Santonian ( approximately 84 Ma ago , after the Coniacian and Campanian ) . Saintes is indeed built on rocks dating from this period , limestone that consist of particular flint nodules of quartz geodes and nodules of iron . Ancient stone quarries located in Capitol Hill or Bellevue , partially filled or converted to permit fungiculture , make remember that they were long used for the construction of various buildings , though they can be cracked by frost . Nearer to the river , the Createceous pleateau gives way to more or less recent alluvial grasslands composed of ' ' bri ' ' , a type of clay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 65 Ma ago , and continued for a part of the Paleogene. # Districts # The town is divided in several administrative areas : Les Boiffiers , Les Tourneurs , L'Ormeau de Pied , Recouvrance , La Fentre , Saint-Rmy , Saint-Vivien , Saint-Eutrope , Saint-Pierre , Saint-Pallais , Saint-Sbastien de Bouard , La Rcluse , Le Maine-Saint-Sorlin and Bellevue. # # Left bank ( ' ' Rive gauche ' ' ) # # The neighborhood of Saint-Pierre lies between the hill of the Capitole and the Charente . It possesses a significant number of historic monuments , which explains its integration in a conservation area that lies over more of 65 ha . Built around the cathedral Saint-Pierre , the ' ' place du march ' ' and the ' ' place du Synode ' ' , it is crossed by pedestrian alleys around which can be found numerous medieval , renaissance and classic buildings . A little westwards lies the neighbourhood of Saint-Eutrope , that has developed over the centuries around a rocky elevation limited by two small valleys at right angles to the river . Dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Clunian priory and several hillside houses . Little alleys lead to the ' ' vallon des Arnes ' ' below , where is situated the Roman amphiteatre , in a park named ' ' Parc des Arnes ' ' . The ' ' cours Reverseaux ' ' and the ' ' cours des Aptres de la libert ' ' separate the neighborhood of Saint-Eutrope from the ' ' faubourg Berthonnire ' ' , bordered by the hill of Saint-Eutrope at the west and by the hill of the Capitole at the north . Once located out of the city walls , it included some hostelries and inns for pilgrims . The streets of the ' ' faubourg ' ' converge toward the ' ' place Saint-Louis ' ' , the ' ' place de l'Aubarre ' ' and the ' ' place Blair ' ' , dominated by a column of Liberty erected during the Revolution . The ' ' square Goulebenze ' ' stands between the ' ' place Blair ' ' and the river . The neighbourhoods of ' ' les Boiffiers ' ' and ' ' Bellevue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ' ' avenue de Saintonge ' ' ; they consist mainly in low-rent housing ( HLM ) and suburban housing standing on a plateau limited by the Charente . Bellevue counts inhabitants on 17 ha ; it is listed as a zone urbaine sensible ( ZUS ) . In a triangle formed by the ' ' cours du marchal Leclerc ' ' , the ' ' cours Genet ' ' and the ' ' rocade ouest ' ' ( bypass ) , the neighbourhood of Recouvrance contains a lyce , the former seminary , the Yvon Chevalier stadium and a shopping mall . The water tower of Recouvrance is decorated by frescoes by contemporary artist Michel Genty . The northern part of the agglomeration is formed by the Saint-Vivien neighborhood , an old faubourg occupied since the Antiquity and where are situated the ' ' thermes de Saint-Saloine ' ' , ancient Roman baths . # # Right bank ( ' ' Rive droite ' ' ) # # The neighborhood of Saint-Pallais was probably urbanized in Antiquity . Structured around the main access way of the Roman city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bridge with a monumental entrance , the Arch of Germanicus . Knowing a relative development during the Middle Ages , it sees the establishment of a funeral basilica dedicated to the bishop Palladius ( later replaced by the glise Saint-Pallais , which gives its name to the neighborhood ) , then a Benedictine abbey of women amongst the largest in the region , the Abbaye aux Dames de Saintes . The presence of this monumental heritage led to the integration of part of the neighborhood in a conservation area . It is during the 19th century that the neighborhood begins to develop . The antic bridge is destroyed and replaced in 1879 by the ' ' pont Bernard-Palissy ' ' , a few meters upstream ; the ' ' avenue Gambetta ' ' and the ' ' place Bassompierre ' ' are formed ; the train station , the Gare de Saintes , the prison , the Haras national de Saintes , the ' ' parc Pierre-Mends France ' ' , the ' ' Jardin public Fernand Chapsal ' ' and the protected area of the ' ' prairie de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communes # # Transportation # # Roads # Saintes is a transportation hub of some importance , connected by two motorways and several secondary roads , national and departmental , that converge towards the ' ' rocade ' ' ( partly a 2x2 ) that bypasses the city on its western and southern sides . The A10 autoroute ( France ) , operated locally by Autoroutes du Sud de la France , passes through the commune in its western part , in a north-south axis . It can be accessed by the interchange 35 . By the A10 , Saintes is 125 km from Bordeaux , 140 km from Poitiers , 470 km from Paris . The A837 autoroute is a spur road of the A10 that links Saintes to Rochefort , the third city in the department . Saintes is also located on the way of the Route Centre-Europe Atlantique , an expressway that links it to Limoges and Lyon in the east . The section Saintes-Saujon ( 2x2 ways ) has been opened to traffic in 2008 ; the towns are now 25 minutes apart by car . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocade ' ' is formed in its western part by the national road 137 , that meets two important ways , the departmental road 728 ( that links Saintes to the Island of Oleron by Marennes ) and the departmental road 150 that intersects with the rocade near the locality of Diconche . In its southern part , the rocade integrates the national road 141 , that runs towards Cognac , Angoulme and Limoges . The departmental road 150 , at the end of the east part , runs towards Niort by **29;17;TOOLONG et Saint-Jean-d'Angly . The town center of Saintes is bypassed by the ' ' avenue de Saintonge ' ' or departmental road 24 , that crosses the Charente with the bridge de Saintonge , opened in 1969. # Train # The Gare de Saintes ( train station ) is located at the focal point of five railways that link the agglomeration to Nantes ( by La Rochelle ) , Bordeaux , Angoulme , Niort and Royan ; the trains are mainly part of the regional rail network TER Poitou-Charentes and the network Corail Intercits In 1894 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network of tramways that was stopped in 1934 . In 1894 was also founded a secondary railway 42 km long linking Saintes to Mortagne-sur-Gironde , by Gmozac , then a somewhat important economic center ; however , this railway was dismantled in 1947 . The importance of this railway network is explained by the designation of Saintes as the seat of the Compagnie des chemins de fer des Charentes in 1867 , then as the regional seat of the VIIIth arrondissement of the Chemins de fer de l ' tat from 1911 to 1971 . The SNCF is still a major employer in the city , and new depots and workshops have been opened in 2009 and 2010. # Population # <center> From 1793 to 2007 **6;48;br <timeline> Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.7) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.7,0.9,0.7) ImageSize = width:800 height:350 PlotArea = left:50 bottom:30 top:30 right:50 DateFormat = x.y Period =from:0 till:30000 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify ScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:5000 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:1000 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar:1791 bar:1792 bar:1793 bar:1794 bar:1795 bar:1796 bar:1797 bar:1798 bar:1799 bar:1800 text:1800 bar:1801 bar:1802 bar:1803 bar:1804 bar:1805 bar:1806 bar:1807 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar:1818 bar:1819 bar:1820 text:1820 bar:1821 bar:1822 bar:1823 bar:1824 bar:1825 bar:1826 bar:1827 bar:1828 bar:1829 bar:1830 bar:1831 bar:1832 bar:1833 bar:1834 bar:1835 bar:1836 bar:1837 bar:1838 bar:1839 bar:1840 text:1840 bar:1841 bar:1842 bar:1843 bar:1844 bar:1845 bar:1846 bar:1847 bar:1848 bar:1849 bar:1850 bar:1851 bar:1852 bar:1853 bar:1854 bar:1855 bar:1856 bar:1857 bar:1858 bar:1859 bar:1860 text:1860 bar:1861 bar:1862 bar:1863 bar:1864 bar:1865 bar:1866 bar:1867 bar:1868 bar:1869 bar:1870 bar:1871 bar:1872 bar:1873 bar:1874 bar:1875 bar:1876 bar:1877 bar:1878 bar:1879 bar:1880 text:1880 bar:1881 bar:1882 bar:1883 bar:1884 bar:1885 bar:1886 bar:1887 bar:1888 bar:1889 bar:1890 bar:1891 bar:1892 bar:1893 bar:1894 bar:1895 bar:1896 bar:1897 bar:1898 bar:1899 bar:1900 text:1900 bar:1901 bar:1902 bar:1903 bar:1904 bar:1905 bar:1906 bar:1907 bar:1908 bar:1909 bar:1910 bar:1911 bar:1912 bar:1913 bar:1914 bar:1915 bar:1916 bar:1917 bar:1918 bar:1919 bar:1920 text:1920 bar:1921 bar:1922 bar:1923 bar:1924 bar:1925 bar:1926 bar:1927 bar:1928 bar:1929 bar:1930 bar:1931 bar:1932 bar:1933 bar:1934 bar:1935 bar:1936 bar:1937 bar:1938 bar:1939 bar:1940 text:1940 bar:1941 bar:1942 bar:1943 bar:1944 bar:1945 bar:1946 bar:1947 bar:1948 bar:1949 bar:1950 bar:1951 bar:1952 bar:1953 bar:1954 bar:1955 bar:1956 bar:1957 bar:1958 bar:1959 bar:1960 text:1960 bar:1961 bar:1962 bar:1963 bar:1964 bar:1965 bar:1966 bar:1967 bar:1968 bar:1969 bar:1970 bar:1971 bar:1972 bar:1973 bar:1974 bar:1975 bar:1976 bar:1977 bar:1978 bar:1979 bar:1980 text:1980 bar:1981 bar:1982 bar:1983 bar:1984 bar:1985 bar:1986 bar:1987 bar:1988 bar:1989 bar:1990 bar:1991 bar:1992 bar:1993 bar:1994 bar:1995 bar:1996 bar:1997 bar:1998 bar:1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width:10 align:left bar:1793 from:0 till : 8388 bar:1800 from:0 till : 10050 bar:1806 from:0 till : 10300 bar:1821 from:0 till : 10274 bar:1831 from:0 till : 10437 bar:1836 from:0 till : 9559 bar:1841 from:0 till : 9994 bar:1846 from:0 till : 11363 bar:1851 from:0 till : 11569 bar:1856 from:0 till : 11927 bar:1861 from:0 till : 10962 bar:1866 from:0 till : 11570 bar:1872 from:0 till : 12437 bar:1876 from:0 till : 13725 bar:1881 from:0 till : 15763 bar:1886 from:0 till : 17327 bar:1891 from:0 till : 18461 bar:1896 from:0 till : 20285 bar:1901 from:0 till : 18219 bar:1906 from:0 till : 19025 bar:1911 from:0 till : 20802 bar:1921 from:0 till:19152 bar:1926 from:0 till:20468 bar:1931 from:0 till:20592 bar:1936 from:0 till:21160 bar:1946 from:0 till : 23441 bar:1954 from:0 till:23768 bar:1962 from:0 till:25717 bar:1968 from:0 till:26507 bar:1975 from:0 till:26891 bar:1982 from:0 till:25471 bar:1990 from:0 till:25874 bar:1999 from:0 till:25595 bar:2007 from:0 till:26401 TextData= fontsize:S pos : ( 50,10 ) text:source Cassini and INSEE </timeline> </center> # Sights # *The Arch of Germanicus , a triumphal arch , was built at the entrance to a bridge , where the main Roman road crossed the Charente River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saved by Prosper Mrime and rebuilt at its present location on the bank of the river . *Ruins of the Roman amphitheatre can be found on the left bank of the Charente , near the summit of the hill upon which the town was built .
