@@750514 The Nissan Micra , known in Latin America and in most of Asia as the Nissan , is a supermini car produced by the Japanese manufacturer Nissan since 1982 . In Japan , the March replaced the Japanese-market Nissan Cherry and was exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealership network ' ' Nissan Cherry Store ' ' until 1999 , when the Cherry network was combined into Nissan Red Stage until 2003 . Until Nissan began selling badge engineered superminis from other Japanese manufacturers , the March was Nissan 's smallest vehicle , and was not renamed and sold at other Japanese Nissan dealership networks . # First generation ( K10 ; 19821992 ) # related = Nissan Figaro **6;50792;br Nissan Be-1 **6;50800;br Nissan Pao # Micra K10 # The original Micra ( chassis name K10 ) was introduced in October 1982 as a challenger to the Honda City , and Toyota Starlet . It was intended to replace the Nissan Cherry as the company 's competitor in the supermini sector , as the Cherry model sold in Europe had progressively become larger with each successive generation . In Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' locations , as the Japanese market Cherry was renamed March . The bodystyle was originally designed for Fiat as a replacement for the Fiat 127 , but Fiat then adopted the Giugiaro styled Uno instead . It was introduced in the European market in 1983 , and in Canada in 1984 for the 1985 model year ( replacing the slightly larger Nissan Pulsar hatchbacks ) . Because the Micra was launched during Nissan 's rebranding effort to systematically phase out the Datsun name , a small appeared on the tailgate for the first two years , and in some European markets , the car was known as the Datsun-Nissan Micra . The Datsun badges had disappeared completely by the end of 1984 . The Micra was initially available with an extremely refined all-aluminium MA10S SOHC engine , developing 50PS or 55PS in the high compression version . It was also available with either automatic or 5-speed gearbox , both of which were unusual in a supermini at this time . It was one of several major small cars to be launched onto the European market during 1983 . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vauxhall Nova ( a Britain-only model which had been launched in Spain the previous year as the Opel Corsa ) and the second generation of the Ford Fiesta . The model was revised in June 1985 , identifiable by the slightly larger rear lamp clusters . The Japanese market saw the debut of the first Micra Turbo/MA10ET , where Nissan grafted a turbocharger to the small 1.0 L engine . Another facelift came in March 1989 , which consisted of some minor upgrades such as deeper bumpers , a new front grille , minor interior details , and headlight changes . It also saw the introduction of an electronically controlled carburettor , the larger MA12 1.2 L engine with 60 PS ( 44 kW/59 hp ) and a 5-door hatchback version . In 1988 , Nissan launched a limited 10,000 unit run of its homologated Nissan 1989 Micra Superturbo ( EK10GFR/GAR ) . Both this and the 1988 Micra R ( EK10FR ) featured the same highly advanced sequential compound charged ( supercharger plus turbocharger ) engine in an all-aluminium straight-4 930 cc 8-valve 4-cylinder Nissan MA MA09ERT unit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6400 rpm . This car came with either a 3-speed automatic or 5-speed manual gearbox with viscous limited slip differential , as well as options such as air conditioning and electric mirrors . The Micra Superturbo still holds the crown for the fastest production Micra in Nissan 's history , with factory performance figures of 7.7 seconds to go from 0 to 100 km/h ( 62 mph ) and 15.5 seconds to run a quarter mile . It has a top speed of 180 km/h ( 112 mph ) . In 1989 a facelift Micra was launched with body coloured front grill and enhanced equipment levels . The Micra 's chassis spawned a number of variations . The Be-1 ( BK10 ) , launched at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1985 ( but not sold until 1987 ) , was a limited edition model with a more rounded bodyshape , and only 10,000 were sold . In 1987 , the canvas-topped , retro looking hatchback Pao ( ) ( PK10 ) was launched ( also at the Tokyo Motorshow ) and sold to the public in 1989 ; 51,657 models were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coup was unveiled at the same show in 1989 , but not released until 1991 . Because demand for the Figaro exceeded the 20,000 vehicles built , Nissan sold the car by lottery : winners could place orders for the car . Despite being a JDM-only model , the Figaro is one of the most imported models of the K10 derivatives ; its popularity among numerous celebrity owners helped it earn cult status . The K10 ceased production on 21 December 1992 . During its lifetime , the Micra gained a good reputation for reliability and economy . In 1995 , it topped the small car class in a reliability survey of four to six-year-old cars undertaken by the German Automobile Association ( ADAC ) , with 7.5 recorded breakdowns per 1,000 vehicles for four-year-old Micras and 11.5 for six-year-old cars : this compared with 8.0 breakdowns per 1,000 cars for four-year-old Volkswagen Polos and 15.3 for six-year-old Polos . ( The class loser was the Fiat Uno with 20.7 breakdowns per 1,000 for four-year-old cars and 37.3 for six-year-old Unos . ) For the 1991 model year , a re-badged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nissan Sentra Classic after Nissan announced it would not import the Micra to Canada after 1991 . The Sentra Classics were built in Mexico . # Super S # The Super S trim came available with the second facelift in 1989 . Sporty Super S included a factory bodykit , racing seats and a tachometer and was only available in black , gray , white and red . Despite its appearance it had the same MA12 engine as the standard K10 Micra , although catalytic converters were a non-deletable feature on the car making them slightly less powerful than the non-cat cars .. # Second generation ( K11 ; 19922002 ) # weight = # Micra K11 ( 19921997 ) # The second-generation K11 was built and launched in Japan in early 1992 , and released in Europe in the fourth quarter of the year . It was powered by brand new all-aluminium 1.0 L ( CG10DE ) and 1.3 L ( CG13DE ) DOHC 16-valve engines , with 55 PS DIN ( 40 kW/54 hp ) and 75 PS ( 55 kW/75 bhp ) respectively ( higher outputs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating ) , both with ECCS ( Electronic Concentrated Control System ) fuel injection . It was the second Nissan model line to be produced in the UK at the NMUK plant , Washington Tyne-on-Wear . A diesel version was offered with the 1.5 L PSA TUD market in Europe as Micra 1.5 D. CVT automatic transmission and Power steering was an option on some models , and the equipment list included security features not usually available in this market segment : a toughened safety-cage and side-impact door beams were standard and pre-tensioning seat-belts and a driver 's air-bag were optional . However , the MK2 Micra scored only a modest two stars in Euro NCAP testing in 1997 . Airbags , antilock brakes , electric windows , central locking and air conditioning were as either standard equipment or options on some models in the Micra range . The European model range consisted of 1.0L and LX , 1.3LX , SLX and Super S. The car soon won the European Car of the Year award for 1993 ( the first Japanese car to do so ) and the Good Design Award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the Car of the Year Japan award in 1992 . At its introduction in 1993 , it won the Automotive Researchers ' and Journalists ' Conference Car of the Year award in Japan . Due to having won several awards , this would spawn the V3 Award edition . After minor changes in 1996 , in 1998 , six years after its launch , the Micra received a facelift which saw the whole range get power steering as standard . There was a Cabriolet ( FHK11 ) unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1995 , but it was not sold until August 1997 , with an electric top . These were produced in limited numbers for the Japanese Domestic Market ( JDM ) only . However , much like the Nissan Figaro , some have been imported into the UK unofficially . There was also an estate version called the March Box ( WK11 ) , which was unveiled on November 1999 , with a double folding rear seat , along with an automatic transmission four-wheel drive model . # K11C ( facelift ) # In late 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from late 1997 until early 2003 . Only a few units were produced in 1997 , as most of them started in 1998 . The cumulative visual changes from the first models included a revised front grille and headlights , redesigned front and rear bumpers , oval instead of round side repeater indicators , major changes to the interior and dashboard , redesigned rear light lenses , and a radio aerial repositioned from the top of the right-hand A-pillar to the middle of the roof , towards the rear . In late 2000 , the original facelift was replaced by a second version , technically being quite similar . Changes included new lights on the bumper , an altered lower body , orange turn signals and minor changes to the interior . Further changes included a redesigned rear wiper which rested horizontally instead of vertically , and the centre high level brake lamp being reduced in size and mounted at the top of the rear window , instead of on the parcel shelf . The 1.3l CG13DE engine offered in previous K11s was removed in the second facelift , and replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.0l CG10DE remained in the second facelift models , however both engines featured individual coilpacks instead of a single distributor as found in older units . In 2001 Muji , the well-known Japanese non-brand issued a limited release of 1,000 badgeless and decontented Nissan Marches , only available online . It was intended as an exercise to test their online marketing systems and was sold as the Muji Car 1000 ( 1000 ) . The rear seat is upholstered in vinyl , the hubcaps are minimal , and the car was only offered in marble white . The Muji Car 1000 has a four-speed automatic transmission and the 1 litre CG10DE engine . By late 2002 , the new K12 was introduced ( although the S and SE models were still being built ) . They were fully replaced by K12 in early 2003. # Bolero # The Bolero ( also known as the Verita ) was a luxury model available in certain markets from 1999 to 2003 . It featured a redesigned exterior and an interior , which now had leather seats . # Super S # Super S trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to SR ( Facelift ) ; Differences include a slightly faster 3.6 turns lock-to-lock rack , over the standard 3.8 turns , different colour coded front and rear bumpers , colour coded wing mirrors and bump strips , rear wrap around spoiler , front driving lights , remote fuel flap opening , wider 175/60/r13 tyres , rear ash tray , tachometer , more heavily bolstered seats , split folding rear seats and rear speaker shelf as standard . Features such as electric windows and power steering were still optional extras . The only engine available for the Super S was the 75 bhp CG13DE/ 1.3 twin cam 16v engine . The Micra Super S 1.3 facing competition along with Toyota Starlet Glanza S 1.3 , Subaru Justy 1.3 4x4 , Fiat Punto GT , both have similar specs and performance . # Third generation ( K12 ; 20022010 ) # # Micra K12 ( 20022007 ) # The next version of the Micra , the K12 , was unveiled in production form at the 2002 Paris Motor Show , following the lines of the Nissan mm.e concept car presented the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Japanese market in early 2002 and to the European market in early 2003 . The car was radically redesigned : it featured a new , 70 mm longer wheelbase ( developed with Renault ) and an even more curvy exterior that was taller and slightly wider . Its most distinctive feature was a pair of prominent headlamps that extended to the wing-tops . The redesign coincided with the Japanese Nissan dealership network ' ' Nissan Cherry Store ' ' being renamed ' ' Nissan Red Stage ' ' in 1999 . Other additions included a sliding rear seat and the option of keyless ignition on higher specification models . The range of engines included improved 1.2 ( CR12DE ) and 1.4 ( CR14DE ) petrol models , and a Renault-sourced 1.5 diesel unit ( K9K ) . The automatic CVT transmission of the previous model was replaced by a conventional automatic transmission . The K12 was well received by the motor industry and set a new standard for the superminis that followed it . # #Nissan March ( 2002 ) # # The vehicle was unveiled in Nissan Headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display featuring the wide array of color variations .

Shown at the Geneva Motor Show without running gear and engine , being only a display car , it was later given the go-ahead and Nissan commissioned Ray Mallock Ltd to insert a mid-mounted BTCC-derived Primera QG20DE engine for show and press demonstration purposes . In 2005 , Nissan UK decided to replace the Primera engine with a VQ35DE from a 350Z with a modified Altima SE-R gearbox for user-friendliness on the road .

The CVT raises the transmission ratio by more than 20% compared to other CVTs in its class , providing enhanced responsiveness on starting and acceleration and improved quietness during high-speed driving . With the auxiliary transmission , the size and weight of the CVT unit is significantly reduced . Friction is reduced by about 30% compared to other CVTs in its class , achieved by the increased transmission ratio , reduced pulley size and weight , and reduced oil agitating resistance helping improve fuel economy . An electric oil pump is adopted in vehicles equipped with Idling Stop . Quicker oil pressure response improves startup performance and thus contributes to an improvement in fuel economy .

Class leading performance , a surprisingly dynamic chassis with well sorted suspension , roomy interior and above average build quality were the Micra 's strengths in comparison to its Korean competitors like the Hyundai Excel , Daewoo Cielo and Ford Festiva . A poor exchange rate between the UK and Australia meant the Micra 's pricing was rather steep and Australian buyers saw the cheaper Koreans and more established Japanese-sourced superminis , such as the Suzuki Swift and Daihatsu Charade , as offering better value for money . Also , the Micra received the lowest possible rating ( one star ) in Australian crash tests . The Micra was dropped from Nissan Australia 's line-up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being sold only as a 5-door hatchback , and coming from Japan and not the UK. # Canada # In Canada , the K10-J was sold and branded as the Nissan Micra . It came standard with the larger MA12S inline 4-cylinder OHC 1.2 L ( 1235 cc ) engine . The Nissan Micra was finally discontinued in Canada in 1991 , replaced by the Nissan Sentra Classic , but many K10s are still running on Canadian roads today . In 2007 , Nissan introduced the substantially larger Versa to the Canadian line up as the new entry-level model . On January 9 , 2014 , Nissan Canada Inc. announced they are bringing the subcompact Micra back to the Canadian market after 21 years of absence . The car will be sold starting spring 2014 as a 2015 year model , taking the place of the slow-selling Versa sedan , which is being cancelled . The car will not be sold in the United States .

A rebranded variant of Micra named Pulse is sold by Renault in India . It has the same interiors as the Micra though the styling on the exterior is slightly modified . Having same specifications , features and engines as the Micra it 's similarly priced . # Mexico # One of the four factories which produce the Nissan Micra K13 is located in Mexico . The Nissan Micra K13 is called the Nissan March in Mexico and went on sale in late March 2011 , it began production at the Aguascalientes plant in early March . The Nissan March is sold in 4 trim levels : Drive , Sense , Advance and SR . The base Drive trim level does not have air conditioning and rear window wipers and has black mirrors ; this trim level also lacks a radio and comes with 14-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds air conditioning , Mp3 radio player , colour-coded mirrors and a rear window wiper .

All trim levels come standard with a 5-speed manual transmission and with the 1.6-litre engine with 106 hp . It replaced the Nissan Platina in its assembly plant and lineup , plus the previous-generation Micra was sold in Mexico using the Micra name . Even though the March was meant to replace the Platina sedan , the Juke ( using the same Micra platform ) took the Micra 's Mexican place after the 2011 model year . # Taiwan # In Taiwan , the K11 March was sold from 1993 to 2007 . It was sold in three generations . The last generation was a facelifted and improved version called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LED rear light clusters , side mirror indicators , and an updated front end with crystal headlights .

Notable differences included rounded headlights and taillights , a distinctive front end , along with a chrome and faux wood trimmed interior . All Taiwan K11s came with the CG13DE engine . There was also a three-box sedan called the March Cubic available ; its taillights , trunklid , and rear bumpers were different from those used in Japanese market versions . At the end of 2011 , the Nissan March returned to the Taiwanese market as the K13 . The HR15DE is currently the only engine available . A 4-speed automatic is the only transmission option as well . # Thailand # One of the four factories which produce the Nissan Micra K13 is located in Thailand . In Thailand , the Micra K13 was launched , as Nissan March , at the Bangkok motor show on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to 537,000 baht . By early July 2010 , the company has received about 8,000 sales order and said new buyers would have to wait for five months . The company expects to produce 90,000 units in 2010 . In April 2013 , the facelifted version of March are revealed , with some upgrade on equipment include LED rear lamps , redesigned grille , headlamps , wheels , improved interior and addition of front airbags in all version . # Republic of Ireland # In the Republic of Ireland , the Micra K11 was a popular car . The trim levels were aligned with mainland Europe . Controversy arose , however , in March 2014 when a 2005 blue Micra entered the Irish Sea at Bettystown , County Meath . The car was initially left in the water overnight , totally submerged , but was later recovered by the Drogheda Coast Guard and Meath County Council . # UK # From 1992 Micras were built in the UK at the NMUK plant in Sunderland , Tyne and Wear , where a total of 2,368,704 were built at its close in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sale the UK over the summer of 1983 , and it was an instant sales success . In its best year , 1990 , it was the eleventh most popular new car in the UK with just under 50,000 sales . It was a popular choice with driving instructors and undemanding motorists thanks to its ease of driving , solid build and durable mechanical components . 343,411 were sold in nearly a decade . As recently as early 2007 , almost 15 years after the last examples were sold , 96,421 examples were still reported to be in circulation , and four years on , as the 20th anniversary of its demise approaches , the number remaining on Britain 's roads is likely to be still well into five figures . It compares particularly well to many other popular small cars in Britain of its era , particularly the British-built Austin Metro and Italian Fiat Uno . # #K11# # The second incarnation of the Micra , the K11 , was launched in the UK at the end of 1992 , with production taking place in Britain at the Sunderland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited range of engines : 1.0 and 1.3 petrol units . A facelift over the summer of 2000 saw the 1.3 shelved and replaced with a 1.4 unit . This upgrade , after a previous makeover in 1998 , enhanced the Micra 's appeal and it was still fairly popular on the launch of its successor in December 2002 . The Micra K11 ( as it is known in Europe ) , was the third model after the Nissan Bluebird and Primera built in Nissan 's NMUK plant in Sunderland , Tyne and Wear . In 1998 , the Sunderland , plant produced its millionth Micra , becoming the first Japanese manufacturer in Europe to achieve the milestone . On January 16 , 2013 , popular YouTube star Vsauce and FastFuriousAndFunny held up a Nissan Micra K11 with 180 rubber bands . They later smashed the car . # #K12# # Like the previous version of the Micra , the third generation model , the K12 , was made at the Sunderland plant . It had a wider range of engines , including 1.2 petrol and Renault-sourced 1.5 direct-injection diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chassis would form the basis of the next Renault Clio , launched in 2005 but still built in France . This stylish , all-new Micra helped Nissan bolster its market share of the supermini sector , which had been declining in the final year or two of its predecessor 's life . Although it has never featured in the SMMT 's official top 10 best-selling cars in the UK , it has been among the best-selling 10 cars in Britain among private buyers for virtually all of its production life . In 2003 , the BBC 's ' ' Top Gear ' ' programme featured a segment on cars that gave value for money , highlighting specification that could be purchased for 9,000 . The Micra K12 was selected and tested by presenter Richard Hammond , who gave it a positive review . This was despite comparing its qualities to those of a Boeing 737 , concluding that the Micra had all the toys . However , when Hammond tested the Micra C+C in 2006 , he was less than enthusiastic . This was because his model was coloured pink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving it with a paper bag over his head . The pink C+C was one of only five , made specifically for Nissan 's sponsorship of the C+C TLC Tour in 200506 , in support of the Breakthrough Breast Cancer charity . Such was the public 's response that Nissan subsequently announced the launch of the Micra C+C Pink , limited to 100 models . These quickly sold out and another production run was announced in August 2006 , this time limited to 175 cars . In July 2004 , Nissan announced that a Coral Blue K12 Micra had become NMUK 's one millionth car for the UK market , and that its Sunderland , plant had produced over 250,000 K12s since the model 's launch , for sale in up to 45 markets . In August 2006 , the K10 was still receiving credit for its impressive durability . An ' ' Auto Express ' ' survey revealed that of the 340,000 K10 Micras registered in the UK between 1983 and 1992 , 96,000 were still on the road nearly 30% , an impressive figure for a car which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a far higher rating than the Fiat Uno and the Austin Metro , both of which had dwindled away to less than 3% . In 2007 , with the Micra K12C , the model grades were brought into line with the rest of the Nissan UK range , namely Visia , Acenta , Tekna , 160 SR and Active Luxury . The Micra C+C convertible was available in Visia , Acenta , Tekna and Active Luxury grades . However , the 1.6-litre engine is available for all models , save the Visia. # Reputation and popularity # The K10/K11 generations of Micra were known for reliability , excellent build quality , and user friendliness . The K12 model has received consistently good reviews , with the main criticisms being the lack of head room and luggage space in the rear . There are numerous tuning parts available for the car . Engine transplants are not new for the Micra , as many owners with mechanical skills have installed the SR20DE and more commonly , the GA16DE into their K11s . Turbocharger kits are a popular choice for the K11 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous car in the event of a crash for the models produced between 1988 and 1995 . However , safety specification has improved with successive models . The Micra 's Euro NCAP ratings are two stars for the K11 and four for the K12 . The K12 Micra came top of its class in ' ' What Car ? ' ' magazine 's Security Supertest in 2003 , passing both entry and driveaway tests and achieving a maximum score for its locking system and immobiliser . In 2005 , the UK motor insurance research expert introduced a standard for keyless go , requiring the device to be inoperable at a distance of more than 10 cm from the vehicle . In an independent test , the Micra was found to be the most secure , while certain BMW and Mercedes models failed , being theoretically capable of allowing cars to be driven away while their owners were refuelling . In ' ' What Car ? s Reliability Supertest in 2007 , Nissan was ranked 6th out of 26 manufacturers overall , with the K11 Micra ( 19982002 ) being its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Micra in motorsports with the March Superturbo R. Introduced in 1987 , this rare pre-facelift K10 weighed in at 740 kg ( 1630 lb ) with half interior , roll cage and tool kit . It was built for the new sub-1600 cc Group A class , and shortly after in 1988 Nissan released the March Superturbo as a road car . While the March was a favourite with the drivers in the Japanese Rally Championship , veteran Swedish rally driver Per Eklund finished the 1988 RAC Rally in 21st position and the 1989 Acropolis Rally Greece in 10th place . During the K11 's production life , there was a series of national rally championship trophies held all over Europe called the Micra Challenge . This was intended as a cheap introduction to rallying , as the cars all had identical 1.3 L race-prepared engines . The UK series ran between 1995 and 1999 . This model is still used in club and national rallies . In France , the 1.3 L model was used as the basis for a circuit racing one-make cup for celebrity drivers , the Nissan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-make trophy alongside the National Rally Championship for Beginners . Both K10 and K11 models are very popular choices for beginner autograss but due to K10s getting rarer , K11s are more commonly used now In 2005 a K11 model nicknamed Little Bandit , was built with a tuned SR20DET , producing approximately 400 bhp , which competed at several motorsport events . In the late 1990s , a K11 was adapted into a VQ30 mid-engined 4WD configuration to race in the Trophe Andros , the French ice racing series . Drivers who raced this car include rik Comas , Philippe Gache , Stphane Peterhansel and Emmanuel Collard . Nissan sponsors a one-make series in Japan called the March Cup , which has been running since the introduction of the K10 . Usually a JGTC support race , it is held in two separate five-round championships called West Japan Series and East Japan Series , and a ladies series running simultaneously . At the end of the season , the best performing cars from both sides meet up for the Champions Cup final at the end the season .
