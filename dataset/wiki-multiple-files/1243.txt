@@7226514 Hotu Matu'a was the legendary first settler and ' ' ariki mau ' ' ( supreme chief or king ) of Easter Island and ancestor of the Rapa Nui People . Hotu Matu'a and his two canoe ( or one double hulled canoe ) colonising party were Polynesians from the now unknown land of Hiva ( probably the Marquesas ) . They landed at Anakena beach and his people spread out across the island , sub-divided it between clans claiming descent from his sons , and lived for more than a thousand years in their isolated island home at the southeastern tip of the Polynesian Triangle . # History # Polynesians first came to Rapa Nui ( also called Easter Island ) sometime between 300 CE and 800 CE . These are the common elements of oral history that have been extracted from island legends . Linguistic , DNA and Pollen analysis all point to a Polynesian first settlement of the island at that time , but it is unlikely that other details can be verified . During this era the Polynesians were colonising islands across a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' led his people from Hiva ; linguistic analysis comparing Rapanui to other Polynesian languages suggests this was the Marquesas Islands . # Legend # Hau-Maka had a dream in which his spirit traveled to a far country , to help look for new land for King ' ' Hotu Matu'a ' ' . He traveled to the ' ' Mata ki te rangi ' ' ( ' Eyes that look to the sky ) . The island has also been called Te pito o te henua , which means the Center of the Earth . Both islands are commonly said to be Easter Island . When Hau-Maka woke , he told the King . The King then ordered seven men to travel to the island from Hiva , their mythical home , to investigate . They found the land and returned to Hiva . The king himself then traveled to the new island . # Theories and controversy # # Tuu ko Iho # Resemblance of the name to an early Mangarevan founder god ' ' Atu Motua ' ' ( Father Lord ) has made some historians suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1860s , along with adopting the Mangarevan language . The real founder would have been ' ' Tuu ko Iho ' ' , who became just a supporting character in the Hotu Matua centric legends . # Dates of the first settlements # There is considerable uncertainty about the accuracy of this legend as well as the date of settlement . Published literature suggests the island was settled around 300-400 CE , or at about the time of the arrival of the earliest settlers in Hawaii . Some scientists say that Easter Island was not inhabited until 700-800 CE . This date range is based on glottochronological calculations and on three radiocarbon dates from charcoal that appears to have been produced during forest clearance activities , while a recent study , with radiocarbon dates from what is thought to be very early material , proves the island was settled by 1200 CE . This seems to be supported by the latest information on island 's deforestation that could have started around the same time . Any earlier human activity seems to be insignificant or low impact . # South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out many cultural similarities between Easter Island and South American Indian cultures which he suggested might have resulted from some settlers arriving also from the continent . According to local legends , a group of long-eared unknown men referred to as ' ' hanau eepe ' ' had arrived on the island sometime after Polynesians , introducing the stone carving technology and attempting to enslave the local Polynesians . Some early accounts of the legend place ' ' hanau epe ' ' as the original residents and Polynesians as later immigrants coming from Oparo . After mutual suspicions erupted in a violent clash , the ' ' hanau eepe ' ' were overthrown and exterminated , leaving only one survivor . The first description of island 's demographics by Jacob Roggeveen in 1722 still claimed that the population consisted of two distinctive ethnic groups , one being clearly Polynesian and the other white with so lengthened earlobes that they could tie them behind their necks . Roggeveen also noted how some of the islanders were generally large in stature . Islanders ' tallness was also witnessed by the Spanish who visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 199 cm . The fact that sweet potatoes , a staple of the Polynesian diet , and several other domestic plants - up to 12 in Easter Island - are of South American origin indicates that there may have been some contact between the two cultures . Either Polynesians have traveled to South America ' ' and ' ' back , or South American balsa rafts have drifted to Polynesia , possibly unable to make a return trip because of their less developed navigational skills and more fragile boats , or both . Polynesian connections in South America have been noticed among the Mapuche Indians in central and southern Chile . The Polynesian name for the small islet of Sala y Gmez ( ' ' Manu Motu Motiro Hiva ' ' , Bird 's islet on the way to a far away land ) ' ' east ' ' of Easter Island has also been seen as a hint that South America was known before European contacts . Further complicating the situation is that the word ' ' Hiva ' ' ( far away land ) was also the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eastern origin for the first inhabitants was unanimous among the islanders in all early accounts . Mainstream archeology is skeptical about any non-Polynesian influence on the island 's prehistory , although the discussion has become political . DNA sequence analysis of Easter Island 's current inhabitants ( a tool not available in Heyerdahl 's time ) offers strong evidence of Polynesian origins . However , since few islanders survived the 19th century slave raids , epidemics and deportations ( perhaps only 0.25% of the peak population ) , this evidence depends on how representative the survivors were of the general Rapanui population .
