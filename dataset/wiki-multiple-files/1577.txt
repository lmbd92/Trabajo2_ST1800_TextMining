@@11123514 1:35 scale is the most popular scale for model military vehicles , with an extensive lineup of models and aftermarket parts available from a wide variety of manufacturers . The roots of 1:35 as a military modelling scale lie in early motorized plastic tank kits . To accommodate electric motors and gearboxes , these models needed to be made in a larger scale . There were many companies making such tanks , but it was Tamiya 's example that made 1:35 a ' ' de facto ' ' standard . Company chairman Shunsaku Tamiya explains the origins of the scale in his book ' ' Master Modeler ' ' : # After the success of the Panther , I thought it would be a good idea for us to produce other tanks from different countries in the same scale . I measured the Panther and it turned out to be about 1/35 of the size of the original . This size had been chosen simply because it would accommodate a couple of B-type batteries . Tamiya 's 1/35 series tanks eventually got to be known around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather awkward scale . # Early kits in the scale , built around bulky motorization components , often sacrificed scale appearance and detail , but their large size and potential for intricate superdetailing appealed to hobbyists . Over the years , kits have become more and more detailed and accurate , and nowadays there is a whole industry in 1:35 dedicated to offering aftermarket detail parts for kits . After a new kit is released , companies like Aber and Eduard usually make detail sets available for it , allowing modellers to replace kit parts with more accurate photoetched alternatives . In terms of model range , 1:35 is typically limited to military land vehicles and figures . Some helicopter kits also exist in the scale , whereas large airplane kits are more commonly done in 1:32 scale . In recent years , there have been some aeroplane releases in 1:35 as well , typically of vehicles operating in close contact with ground forces , such as the Fieseler Storch liaison aircraft or the Horsa glider . The figures are usually designed to go with the AFV 's though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figures are unusual and pre-1914 figures are very rare indeed .
