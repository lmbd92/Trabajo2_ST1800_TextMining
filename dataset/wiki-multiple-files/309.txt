David Balfour , the hero of this tale was marooned for a while on the island having been shipwrecked on the Torran Rocks , which lie to the south . Stevenson 's father , Thomas was involved in the construction of the nearby lighthouses , and the stones for Dhu Heartach were quarried on the island , and the young Robert Louis visited the island on several occasions , recalling one such excursion in his book ' ' Memories and Portraits ' ' . He later based the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story The Merry Men , on the island . Davie Balfour is trapped on the island by his ignorance , and as he says in ' ' Kidnapped : Chapter XIV ' ' - # A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid ; which is only what they call a tidal islet , and except in the bottom of the neaps , can be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours , either dry-shod , or at the most by wading . Even I , who had the tide going out and in before me in the bay , and even watched for the ebbs , the better to get my shellfisheven I ( I say ) if I had sat down to think , instead of raging at my fate , must have soon guessed the secret , and got free . It was no wonder the fishers had not understood me . The wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion , and taken the trouble to come back .

And even as it was , I had paid for it pretty dear , not only in past sufferings , but in my present case ; being clothed like a beggar-man , scarce able to walk , and in great pain of my sore throat . # Stevenson also includes a description of the island : # It was still the roughest kind of walking ; indeed the whole , not only of Earraid , but of the neighbouring part of Mull ( which they call the Ross ) is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among . # Davie Balfour stayed alive during his stay on the island by eating limpets : # I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat ; and among the rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets , which at first I could scarcely strike from their places , not knowing quickness to be needful . There were , besides , some of the little shells that we call buckies ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made my whole diet , devouring them cold and raw as I found them ; and so hungry was I , that at first they seemed to me delicious . #
