@@432514 birthplace = New York City deathplace = Hollywood , California Herman Jacob Mankiewicz ( pronounced ) ; November 7 , 1897 March 5 , 1953 ) was an American screenwriter , who , with Orson Welles , wrote the screenplay for ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' ( 1941 ) . Earlier , he was the Berlin correspondent for the ' ' Chicago Tribune ' ' and the drama critic for ' ' The New York Times ' ' and ' ' The New Yorker ' ' . Alexander Woollcott said that Herman Mankiewicz was the funniest man in New York . Both Mankiewicz and Welles received Academy Awards for their screenplay . He was often asked to fix the screenplays of other writers , with much of his work uncredited . What distinguished his writing from that of other writers were occasional flashes of the Mankiewicz humor and satire that became valued in the films of the 1930s . That style of writing included a slick , satirical , and witty humor , which depended almost totally on dialogue to carry the film . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that period . Film author Pauline Kael credits Mankiewicz with having written , alone or with others , about forty of the films I remember best from the twenties and thirties , adding , I had n't realized how extensive his career was . . . he was a key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and I loved best . These were the hardest-headed periods of American movies . Among the screenplays he wrote or worked on , besides ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' , were ' ' The Wizard of Oz ' ' , ' ' Man of the World ' ' , ' ' Dinner at Eight ' ' , ' ' Pride of the Yankees ' ' , and ' ' The Pride of St. Louis ' ' . Mankiewicz 's younger brother was Joseph L. Mankiewicz ( 19091993 ) , also an Oscar-winning Hollywood director , screenwriter , and producer . # Personal life # Herman Mankiewicz was born in New York City in 1897 .

He arrived in the U.S. with his wife , a dressmaker named Johanna Blumenau , who was from the German-speaking Kurland region . The family lived first in New York and then moved to Wilkes-Barre , Pennsylvania , where Herman 's father accepted a teaching position . In 1909 , Herman 's brother , Joseph L. Mankiewicz ( who himself would have a career as a successful writer , producer , and director ) , was born , and both boys and a sister spent their childhood there . The family moved to New York City in 1913 , and Herman graduated from Columbia University in 1917 . He became an alcoholic , which hurt his career by the late 1930s . His children are screenwriter Don Mankiewicz , politician Frank Mankiewicz and the late novelist Johanna Mankiewicz Davis . # Writer and screenwriter # # Early career # While a reporter in Berlin for the ' ' Chicago Tribune ' ' , he also sent pieces on drama and books to ' ' The New York Times ' ' .

By the end of 1927 , he was head of Paramount 's scenario department , and film critic Pauline Kael , who wrote about him and the creation of ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' in Raising Kane , her famous 1971 ' ' New Yorker ' ' article , wrote that in January , 1928 , there was a newspaper item reporting that he was in New York ' lining up a new set of newspaper feature writers and playwrights to bring to Hollywood , ' and that ' most of the newer writers on Paramount 's staff who contributed the most successful stories of the past year ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eyman notes that Mankiewicz was put in charge of writer recruitment by Paramount . However , as a hard-drinking gambler , he hired men in his own image : Ben Hecht , Bartlett Cormack , Edwin Justus Mayer , writers comfortable with the iconoclasm of big-city newsrooms who would introduce their sardonic worldliness to movie audiences . ; Becoming a major screenwriter Kael notes that beginning in 1926 , Mankiewicz worked on an astounding number of films . In 1927 and 1928 , he did the titles ( the printed dialogue and explanations ) for at least twenty-five films that starred Clara Bow , Bebe Daniels , Nancy Carroll , Wallace Beery , and other public favorites . By then , sound had come in , and in 1929 he did the script as well as the dialogue for ' ' The Dummy , ' ' and did the scripts for many directors , including William Wellman and Josef von Sternberg . Other screenwriters made large contributions , too , but probably none larger than Mankiewicz 's , according to Kael . At the beginning of the sound era he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kael writes , he wrote the kind of movies that were disapproved of as fast and immoral . His heroes were n't soft-eyed and bucolic ; he brought good-humored toughness to the movies , and energy and astringency . And the public responded , because it was eager for modern American subjects . According to Kael , Mankiewicz did not work on every kind of picture . He did n't do Westerns , for example , and once , when a studio attempted to punish him for his customary misbehavior by assigning him to a Rin Tin Tin picture , he rebelled by turning in a script that began with the craven dog frightened by a mouse and reached its climax with a house on fire and the dog taking a baby ' ' into ' ' the flames. : 246 ; Writer of satire and comedy Shortly after his arrival on the West Coast , he sent a telegram to journalist-friend Ben Hecht in New York : Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots .

What distinguished his screenplays were occasional flashes of the Mankiewicz humor and satire that proved to be a foreshadowing of a new type of slick , satirical , typically American film that depended almost totally on dialogue for its success . Between 1929 and 1935 , he was credited with working on a least twenty films , many of which he received no credit for . Between 1930 and 1932 he was either producer or associate producer on four comedies and helped write their screenplays without credit : ' ' Laughter ' ' , ' ' Monkey Business ' ' , ' ' Horse Feathers ' ' , and ' ' Million Dollar Legs ' ' , which many critics considered one of the funniest comedies of the early 1930s . In 1933 , he co-wrote ' ' Dinner at Eight ' ' , which was based on the George S. Kaufman/Edna Ferber play , and became one of the most popular comedies at that time and remains a classic comedy . ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1938 , he was assigned as the first of ten screenwriters to work on ' ' The Wizard of Oz ' ' . Three days after he started writing he handed in a seventeen-page treatment of what was later known as the Kansas sequence . While Baum devoted less than a thousand words in his book to Kansas , Mankiewicz almost balanced the attention on Kansas to the section about Oz . He felt it was necessary to have the audience relate to Dorothy in a real world ' ' before ' ' transporting her to a magic one . By the end of the week he had finished writing fifty-six pages of the script and included instructions to film the scenes in Kansas in black and white . His goal , according to film historian Aljean Harmetz , was to capture in pictures what Baum had captured in wordsthe grey lifelessness of Kansas contrasted with the visual richness of Oz . He was not credited for his work on the film , however . In looking back on his early films , Kael writes that Mankiewicz had , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the films I remember best from the twenties and thirties . I had n't realized how extensive his career was . .. and now that I have looked into Herman Mankiewicz 's career it 's apparent that he was a key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and I loved best . These were the hardest-headed periods of American movies ... and the most highly acclaimed directors of that period , suggests that the writers ... in little more than a decade , gave American talkies their character . ; Banned by the Nazis According to the ' ' New York Times ' ' , in 1935 , while he was a staff writer for MGM , the studio was notified by Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels , then Minister of Education and Propaganda under Adolf Hitler , that films written by Mankiewicz could not be shown in Nazi Germany unless his name was removed from the screen credits . # ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' # Mankiewicz is best known for his collaboration with Orson Welles on the screenplay of ' ' Citizen Kane ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later became a source of controversy over who wrote what . ( Pauline Kael attributed ' ' Kane ' ' s screenplay to Mankiewicz in an essay for which she did not interview Welles and was subsequently strongly disputed by Welles and Peter Bogdanovich . ) Much debate has centered around this issue , largely because of the importance of the film itself , which most agree is a fictionalized biography of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst . According to film biographer David Thomson , however , No one can now deny Herman Mankiewicz credit for the germ , shape , and pointed language of the screenplay .. Mankiewicz biographer Richard Meryman notes that the dispute had various causes , including the way the movie was promoted . When RKO opened the movie on Broadway on May 1 , 1941 , followed by showings at theaters in other large cities , the publicity programs that were printed included photographs of Welles as the one-man band , directing , acting , and writing . In a letter to his father afterwards , Mankiewicz wrote , I 'm particulary furious at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is that there is n't one single line in the picture that was n't in writingwriting from and by mebefore ever a camera turned . According to film historian Otto Friedrich , it made Mankiewicz unhappy to hear Welles quoted in Louella Parsons 's column , before the question of screen credits was officially settled , as saying , ' So I wrote ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' . ' Mankiewicz went to the Screen Writers Guild and declared that he was the original author . Welles later claimed that he planned on a joint credit all along , but Mankiewicz claimed that Welles offered him a bonus of ten thousand dollars if he would let Welles take full credit . .. The Screen Writers Guild eventually decreed a joint credit , with Mankiewicz 's name first . Some time later , Welles commented on this allegation : # God , if I had n't loved him I would have hated him after all those ridiculous stories , persuading people I was offering him money to have his name taken off ... that he would be carrying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . # ; Hearst 's inner circle He became good friends with Hollywood screenwriter Charles Lederer who was Marion Davies 's nephew . Lederer grew up as a Hollywood habitu , spending much time at San Simeon , where Davies reigned as William Randolph Hearst 's mistress . As one of his admirers in the early 1930s , Hearst often invited Mankiewicz to spend the weekend at San Simeon . Herman told Joe his brother to come to the office of their mutual friend Charlie Lederer .. In 1939 , he suffered a broken leg in a driving accident and had to be hospitalized . During his hospital stay , one of his visitors was Orson Welles , who met him earlier and had become a great admirer of his wit . During the months after his release from the hospital , he and Welles began working on story ideas which led to the creation of ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' . Despite Welles ' denial that the film was about Hearst , few people were convincedincluding Hearst . After the release of ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for writing the story . Certain elements in the film were taken from Mankiewicz 's own experience : the sled Rosebud was basedaccording to some sourceson a very important bicycle that was stolen from him .... and some of Kane 's speeches are almost verbatim copies of Hearst 's . Most personally , the word rosebud was reportedly Hearst 's private nickname for Davies ' clitoris . Hearst 's thoughts about the film are unknown ; what is certain is that his extensive chain of newspapers and radio stations blocked all mentions of the film , and refused to accept advertising for it , while some Hearst employees worked behind the scenes to block or restrict its distribution . ; Welles ' Version of Events Welles insisted that ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' was an idea he conceived with Mankiewicz that was initially titled ' ' The American ' ' . In addition to Hearst , the character of Charles Foster Kane was also based on publisher Robert McCormick and other media moguls , including Joseph Pulitzer , as well as businessman Samuel Insull , who built the Civic Opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The screenplay 's use of multiple narrative perspectives came from Joseph Conrad 's ' ' Heart of Darkness ' ' , which was a work that Welles wanted to film . Welles himself had a relationship , several times removed , to Hearst as Marion Davies ' nephew Charles Lederer had married Welles 's ex-wife Virginia Nicolson Welles in 1940 . Lederer became the stepfather of Welles ' daughter . Welles reportedly gave Mankiewicz 300 pages of notes and assigned John Houseman to work with him , and to ensure Mankiewicz stayed sober . On Welles 's instruction , Houseman wrote the opening narration as a pastiche of ' ' The March of Time ' ' newsreels . Orson Welles explained to Peter Bogdanovich about the writers working separately by saying , I left him on his own finally , because we 'd started to waste too much time haggling . So , after mutual agreements on storyline and character , Mank went off with Houseman and did his version , while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine . Taking these drafts , Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz 's contribution to the script , but Welles countered the attacks by saying , At the end , naturally , I was the one making the picture , after allwho had to make the decisions . I used what I wanted of Mank 's and , rightly or wrongly , kept what I liked of my own . Welles added autobiographical allusions to Kane , most noticeably in the treatment of Kane 's childhood and particularly , regarding his guardianship . Welles added features from other famous American lives to create a general and mysterious personality , rather than the narrow journalistic portrait drawn by Mankiewicz . ; Academy Award celebration ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' was nominated for an Academy Award in every possible category , including Best Original Screenplay . Meryman writes , Herman insisted he had no chance to win , though the ' ' Hollywood Reporter ' ' had given the film first place in ten of its twelve divisions . The fear of Hearst , he felt , was still alive . And Hollywood 's resentment and distrust of Welles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived up to his wonderboy ballyhoo . Neither Welles nor Mankiewicz attended the dinner , which was broadcast on radio . Welles was in South America filming ' ' Carnival ' ' , and Herman refused to attend . He did not want to be humiliated , said his wife , Sara . Richard Meryman describes the evening : # On the night of the awards , Herman turned on his radio and sat in his bedroom chair . Sara lay on the bed . As the screenplay category approached , he pretended to be hardly listening . Suddenly from the radio , half screamed , came Herman J. Mankiewicz . Welles 's name as coauthor was drowned out by voices all through the audience calling out , Mank ! Mank ! Where is he ? And audible above all others was Irene Selznick : Where is he ? # George Schaefer ( film producer ) ; The film as a whole Richard Meryman concludes that taken as a whole ... ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' was overwhelmingly Welles 's film , a triumph of intense personal magic . Herman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were mined by Welles . But one marvels at the debt those two self-destroyers owe to each other . Without Welles there would have been no supreme moment for Herman . Without Mankiewicz there would have been no perfect idea at the perfect time for Welles .. to confirm his genius .. The ' ' Citizen Kane ' ' script was true creative symbiosis , a partnership greater than the sum of its parts . # Other films # Mankiewicz wrote and co-wrote many other major screenplays ( including the original version of ' ' Gentlemen Prefer Blondes ' ' and ' ' The Pride of the Yankees ' ' ) , ' ' Dinner at Eight ' ' , and ' ' Pride of St. Louis ' ' . # Death # Mankiewicz was an alcoholic , once famously admonishing his hostess at a formal dinner in her home , after he had vomited on her white tablecloth while dining , not to be concerned because the white wine came up with the fish .
