@@2291514 An agaric is a type of fungal fruiting body characterized by the presence of a pileus ( cap ) that is clearly differentiated from the stipe ( stalk ) , with lamellae ( gills ) on the underside of the pileus . Agaric can also refer to a basidiomycete species characterized by an agaric-type fruiting body . An archaic usage of the word agaric meant ' tree-fungus ' ( after Latin ' ' agaricum ' ' ) ; however , that changed with the Linnaean interpretation in 1753 when Linnaeus used the generic name ' ' Agaricus ' ' for gilled mushrooms . Most species of agarics are classified in the Agaricales , however , this type of fruiting body is thought to have evolved several times independently , hence the Russulales , Boletales , Hymenochaetales , and several other groups of basidiomycetes also contain agaric species . Older systems of classification place all agarics in the Agaricales , and some ( mostly older ) sources still use agarics as a common name for the Agaricales . Contemporary sources now tend to use the term euagarics when referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes used as a common name for members of the genus ' ' Agaricus ' ' , as well as for members of other genera , for example , ' ' Amanita muscaria ' ' is sometimes called fly agaric .
