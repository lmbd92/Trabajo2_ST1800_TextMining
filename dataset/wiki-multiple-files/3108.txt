@@27858514 The 30 foot surf rescue boat is a lifeboat that the United States Coast Guard has used in recent years . The 30 ' long boat is designated the surf rescue boat ( SRB ) and was introduced in 1983. # Design # The 30 ' SRB was self-righting and self baling and designed with marked differences from the typical lifeboats used by the Coast Guard up until the early 1980s . The 30 ' SRB is not considered to be a Motor Lifeboat ( MLB ) , but was generally used in a similar capacity . Designed to perform search and rescue in adverse weather and surf the first 30 ' SRB was built by the Willard Boat Company in Fountain Valley , California . Much of the 30 footer 's design centered around speed . The sides of the hull are made of 5/8 airex foam cored fiberglass reinforced plastic ( FRP ) , and the bottom of the hull is constructed of solid FRP molded in one piece . The boat is 30 ' 4 in length with a 9 ' 4 beam , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear and engine . The 30 footer has a single Detroit Diesel 6V92TI engine , configured by Johnson Towers rated at . The throttles are manually controlled , and the boat has a single screw and rudder . The 30 ' SRB 's were rated for a top speed of 31 kn although most of the hulls fell prey to minor water intrusion into the FRP , which slowed most of the boats to around 28 kn at max RPM . The 30 footer has a range of 130nmi km , and most standard operating procedures dictate that the boat not go more than 20 nmi offshore without a waiver granted from higher level commands . The fuel capacity is 78 gallons at 100% , and the vessel is generally operated with a crew of two , a surfman and an engineer . The crew both stand on the coxswain flat , protected by the superstructure on the bow and stern . The boat 's appearance has caused many to comment that it looks like a Nike Tennis Shoe . # Uses # The intent for the boat is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on scene quickly , get into a surf zone and extract any persons in the water , or to stabilize a situation until the slower and larger motor lifeboat can get on scene . Since 1997 and the introduction of the faster 47 ' MLB and the phasing out of the 44 ' MLBs the need for a quick response vessel diminished making the 30 footers obsolete . The class of vessels underwent an overhaul in the early nineties to extend their life until the newer and faster 47 ' motor lifeboats came into service and in the late 1990s most of the 30 footers were de-commissioned . One still remains on active duty at Motor Lifeboat Station Depoe Bay in Depoe Bay , Oregon and is used almost daily . This station was host to the last 36 ' motor lifeboat in the late 1980s . Even though the boats have many quirks , including dynamic instability , where the boat becomes unstable at high speeds , many surfmen who became qualified on the boats have sworn by them .
