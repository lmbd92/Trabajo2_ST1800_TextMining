According to Bruce , the masters were bought from a man in Phoenix by Bear Family Records ( A Germany based independent record label that specializes in reissues ) . There was another short lived group that Michael was a part of called Our Gang ( Our Gang also featured North High School friend and member of The Tubes , Bill Spooner ) . They never made any known recordings . In 1966 , he replaced John Tatum in a Phoenix band called The Spiders ; featuring Glen Buxton , Dennis Dunaway , John Speer ( replaced by Neal Smith ) , and Vince Furnier ; all from area high schools . One of their top venues was the VIP Club in Phoenix . In 1967 they changed the band 's name to The Nazz but had to change it again in 1968 after a legal-issue over Todd Rungren 's band , Nazz .

He co-wrote many of the hit songs with some or all of the other members of the band . Many times , Michael already had lyrics and music written for a song . The lyrics would then be reworked by Furnier . Two examples of this process are Halo of Flies and No More Mr. Nice Guy . There are several Bruce-only credited songs including Be My Lover from ' ' Killer ' ' . Bruce also sang lead vocal on the majority of Sing Low , Sweet Cheerio on the first album ' ' Pretties For You ' ' and all of Below Your Means and Beautiful Flyaway on the follow-up ' ' Easy Action ' ' , prior to the band 's breakthrough album ' ' Love It to Death ' ' on the Warner Bros. label ; Love It to Death was the first Alice Cooper album produced by Bob Ezrin ( Pretties For You was produced by Frank Zappa and Ian Underwood ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neil Young ) . The Alice Cooper group released five more albums ( Killer , School 's Out , Billion Dollar Babies , Muscle of Love and Alice Cooper 's Greatest Hits ) before taking a break from touring in 1974 ; Several of the members wanted to record their own solo albums . Welcome to My Nightmare would prove to be the most successful of these solo ventures . A full-length , feature film of the original group was also released to the American cinema in 1974 ; Good to See You Again , Alice Cooper . The concert footage was shot on the Billion Dollar Babies Tour in 1973 and included a fictional story about an angry director seeking revenge against the band that was shot at Universal Studios in Los Angeles ( A scene in the Welcome to mMy Nightmare concert film , where Alice smashes the neon headstone with a shovel , was also shot during this time ) . The live concert portion was filmed mostly in Texas ( A good deal of which was shot at Hofheinz Pavilion in Houston , Texas ) between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To See You Again were Bob Dolin , Mick Mashbir and The Amazing Randi ; Dolan performed on keyboards , Mashbir on guitar and Randi as the dentist and Alice 's executioner . # In My Own Way # It was around this time ( 19731974 ) that Bruce began working on his own recordings with a group of musicians that included : Mick Mashbir ( guitars and vocals ) , Bob Dolin ( keyboards and vocals ) , Frank Crandall ( bass and vocals ) and Don Lindley ( percussion and vocals ) ; Mashbir and Dolin had performed as members of the touring band on the ' ' Billion Dollar Babies ' ' tour . This line-up recorded and produced four songs ( If I was King , As Rock Rolls On , Oh , My Love and Nothing on Earth ) that Jack Douglas mixed . When Bruce decided to leave Connecticut in 1974 and move to Lake Tahoe , Crandall and Lindley did not follow . Bruce , Dolin and Mashbir were then faced with finding a new rhythm section . Drummers , such as William Curly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of The Turtles and Crosby , Stills , Nash &amp; Young ) came to play and record at Bruce 's Nevada home . However , they never could find a steady bass player . Bruce 's album , ' ' In My Own Way ' ' was recorded over the course of three months in 1975 with producers , Gene Cornish and Dino Danelli of The Rascals . Many different musicians came down to the Record Plant and participated in the sessions for the album ; Gerry Beckley ( America ) , Jackie Lomax ( The Undertakers , The Lomax Alliance and Badger ) , Ricky Fataar ( The Flames , The Beach Boys &amp; The Rutles ) , Keith Moon ( The Who ) , Brian Garofalo ( session bassist ) , David Foster ( Skylark &amp; Airplay ) , Hunt Sales ( Todd Rundgren , Paris , Iggy Pop , Tender Fury and Tin Machine ) , Tony Sales ( Todd Rundgren , Iggy Pop and Tin Machine ) , Mylon LeFevre , Lynn Carey and many more .

Bruce 's solo album ( ' ' In My Own Way ' ' ) had been sold to Polydor in Germany . Polydor did a very limited test pressing and decided to shelve it without release . Originally , ' Billion Dollar Babies ' started out in the hope that Alice would return and ' ' Battle Axe ' ' would be the new record from the Alice Cooper Group . As history will show , that was n't the outcome . Everyone decided to proceed without Alice . Time Magazine featured the group in a brief but hopeful write-up in 1977 . There had been a fantastic and very theatrical stage show planned in which Bruce and Marconi would battle each other in the fashion of gladiators . In spite of the positive start , the band was embroiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tour was quite brief , as well ( The very imaginative stage show was far too costly , as it would turn out . ) Their only release was 1977 's ' ' Battle Axe ' ' . Unfortunately , the ' ' Battle Axe ' ' record lost any momentum it had when it was recalled for mastering problems which caused the turntable needle to skip . Bruce , Dunaway and Smith had also invested a large sum of their own money in the project . Jack Douglas , who had worked on Muscle of Love with Jack Richardson , was hired to fix the mastering problem . With so many problems weighing them down , the group disbanded . # The Josiah-Bruce Band # In January 1990 , Michael met a man named Josiah who worked with troubled youth . They shared a common interest in music and became friends . Josiah and Bruce soon decided to form a band and call it , The Josiah Bruce Band .

The three piece line-up of the Michael Bruce Group ( Bruce , Hudgens and Powell ) performed in Clarion , Iowa at the first Glen Buxton Memorial ( during their 1998 midwestern tour ) ; Clarion is where Michael 's former band mate passed on and was laid to rest .
