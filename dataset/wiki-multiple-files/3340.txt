@@30636514 related = Audi 80/4000 Audi Quattro The Audi Coup ( B2 , ' ' Typ ' ' 81/85 ) is a two-door coup produced and sold by Audi from 1980 to 1988 . The car was an attempt by Audi to offer a cheaper version of its turbocharged , permanent four-wheel drive Audi Quattro - without turbochargers or four wheel drive . Later , quattro was added as an option ( ' ' Typ ' ' 85 ) . ' ' Typ ' ' 81 was the internal model code for front-wheel drive Audi Coups . # History # The Coup , first displayed at the Paris Salon 1980 , featured a similar body shape to the Quattro , but without the knife-edged fender flares of the more expensive car . Mechanically , the biggest changes from the Quattro to the Coup were the use of a naturally aspirated 1.9 litre carburettor petrol engine , 2.0 litre , 2.1 , 2.2 , or 2.3 litre fuel injected inline five cylinder engine and a front-wheel drive drivetrain . Some lesser Coups were also fitted with a 1.8 litre inline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first year of production a 1.6-litre YN 75PSkW 0 engine was available . The short-lived 1.6 was the only Coup not to be fitted with a black rear spoiler . The Coup was available as just plain Coup or GL ( four-cylinders only ) , Coup GT , and Coup quattro ( without the GT tag ) . From 1986 until the end of production in late 1988 , the Coup GT was also available with the 110-112PSkW 0 1.8-litre ' ' PV/DZ ' ' inline-four best known from the Golf GTi . For the last model year , the new 2,309 cc NG five cylinder was available , offering 136PSkW 0 at 5,600 rpm . This engine became available during 1987 for the last of the Audi Coups sold in the US , where it produced 130hpkW 0 at 5,700 rpm as opposed to the 110hpkW 0 at 5,500 rpm available from the 2.2-litre five which had been used since the facelift for model year 1985 . The Coup had originally gone on sale in the US late in model year 1981 with the 100hpkW 0 2,144 cc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Facelift # The updated Coup , introduced after the German industrial holidays in the autumn of 1984 , was given new , slightly sloped radiator grille and headlights , a large wrap-around bumper with integrated spotlights and turn signals , plastic sill covers , and the large rear spoiler from the Audi Quattro . These changes brought the drag coefficient down to 0.36 . A new dashboard was also introduced , as was a new interior . GL and standard versions were cancelled for model year 1987 and all FWD Coups were from then referred to as Coup GT . For the 1986 model year , the Coups ( as with all Audis ) were available with more catalyzed engine options . Also , the entire B2 range ( Audi 80/90/Coup ) received stainless steel exhausts ( for European markets at least ) . # Coup quattro # Also in September 1984 , Audi made available the option of the quattro permanent four-wheel drive system to produce the Audi Coup quattro , a model which was rarer than the turbocharged Quattro model .

The Coup and Coup quattro models appear almost identical from the outside except for a few minor quattro specifics . While the GT had COUPE GT on the rear side windows , the CQ had the quattro decal as used on the Ur-Quattro . Similarly at the rear , the badging was GT and quattro respectively . The quattro versions also used the Ur-Quattro rear windscreen with quattro written into the heater elements ( very obviously so on a cold and frosty morning ) , and the front grille was also adorned with the quattro badge from the Ur-Q . Inside , the cabin was identical except that the centre console received a differential lock switch , and LED bargraph displays in place of the GT 's three analogue-style gauges . Some Coup quattros were distinguished by a body-coloured rear spoiler . Mechanically , the Coup quattro depended on a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The quattro permanent four-wheel drive drivetrain was almost identical to that used on the Ur-Quattro - the main differences being the use of the Coup GT front struts , smaller 256mm 0 diameter front brake disks , and lower ratios in the gearbox and rear differential . The damper and spring rates were also different from the Ur-Q . It was thus largely identical to the Audi 90 quattro and the North American Audi 4000 quattro . Roadwheels were 6.0Jx14 , with steel or aluminium alloy rims dependent on the market . 7.0Jx15 Ronals , almost identical to the Ur-Quattro wheels , were also available . The CQ/90Q/4000Q also received their own exhaust manifold and downpipe ( 5-3-1 , while FWD versions were 5-2-1 ) . From September 1980 to September 1987 , 174,687 ' ' Typ ' ' 81 Coups were built . Quattro production ran from late 1984 to 1988 , and was in the total region of 8,000 cars .
