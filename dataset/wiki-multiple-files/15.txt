@@30514 The Pogues are a Celtic punk band from London , formed in 1982 and fronted by Shane MacGowan . The band reached international prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s . MacGowan left the band in 1991 due to drinking problems but the band continued first with Joe Strummer and then with Spider Stacy on vocals before breaking up in 1996 . The band reformed in late 2001 , and has been playing regularly ever since , most notably on the US East Coast around St Patrick 's Day and across the UK and Ireland every December . The group has yet to record any new music and , according to Spider Stacy on Pogues.com , has no inclination to do so . Their politically tinged music was informed by MacGowan and Stacy 's punk backgrounds , yet used traditional Irish instruments such as the tin whistle , cittern , mandolin and accordion . The Pogues were founded in Kings Cross , a district of Central London , in 1982 as Pogue Mahone ' ' pogue mahone ' ' being the anglicisation of the Irish ' ' pg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Band history # The future members of the Pogues first met when MacGowan ( vocals ) , Peter Spider Stacy ( tin whistle ) , and Jem Finer ( banjo ) were together in an occasional band called The Millwall Chainsaws in the late 1970s after MacGowan and Stacy met in the toilets at a Ramones gig at The Roundhouse in 1977 . MacGowan was already with The Nips , though when they broke up in 1980 he concentrated a bit more on Stacy 's Millwall Chainsaws , who changed their name to The New Republicans . During this period MacGowan and Finer auditioned unsuccessfully for a licence to busk at Covent Garden . In 1982 James Fearnley ( accordion ) , who had been a guitarist with the Nips , joined MacGowan , Stacy , and Finer , forming the band , then known as Pogue Mahone . The new group played their first gig at The Pindar of Wakefield on 4 October 1982 . They then appeared at Gossips in Dean Street Soho on Thursday 3 November with Trash Trash Trash and The Stingrays .

The band played London pubs and clubs , and released a single , Dark Streets of London , on their own , self-named label , gaining a small reputationespecially for their live performances . They came to the attention of the media and Stiff Records when they opened for The Clash on their 1984 tour . Shortening their name to The Pogues ( partly due to BBC censorship following complaints from Gaelic speakers in Scotland ) they released their first album ' ' Red Roses for Me ' ' on Stiff Records that October . The band gained more attention when the UK Channel 4 's influential music show ' ' The Tube ' ' made a video of their version of Waxie 's Dargle for the show . The performance , featuring Spider Stacy repeatedly smashing himself over the head with a beer tray , became a favourite with the viewers , but Stiff Records refused to release it as a single , feeling it was too late for it to help ' ' Red Roses for Me ' ' .

It was also voted as the 27th greatest song never to reach UK#1 in another VH1 poll , and also voted as the 84th greatest song of all time by BBC Radio 2 listeners in the Sold on Song top 100 poll . In 2007 the record was briefly censored by the BBC because of the word faggot being deemed potentially offensive to gay people . Following protests from listeners , including the mother of Kirsty MacColl , the censorship was lifted .

Vocal duties were for a time handled by Joe Strummer . Spider Stacy took over permanently after Strummer got sacked in spring 1992 . After Strummer 's departure , the remaining seven Pogues recorded in 1993 ' ' Waiting for Herb ' ' , which contained the band 's third and final top twenty single , Tuesday Morning , which became their best-selling single internationally . Terry Woods and James Fearnley then left the band and were replaced by David Coulter and James McNally respectively . Within months of their departures , ill health forced Phil Chevron to leave the band ; he was replaced by his former guitar technician , Jamie Clarke . This line-up recorded the band 's seventh ( and final ) studio album , ' ' Pogue Mahone ' ' . The album was a commercial failure , and , following Jem Finer 's decision to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to call it quits . According to Shane MacGowan , amongst the reasons of the break-up was disagreement concerning the political orientation of his songs , the band not wanting to sing too obvious pro-republican songs though some of their previous songs were already politically engaged : for instance , ' ' Streams of Whiskey ' ' is about the poet and IRA member Brendan Behan . Soon after the break-up Shane MacGowan recorded a song called ' ' Paddy Public Enemy Number One ' ' as a tribute to the Republican leader Dominic McGlinchey , a former leader of the INLA killed a few years before . # Post-breakup # After the Pogues ' break-up , the three remaining long-term members ( Spider Stacy , Andrew Ranken and Darryl Hunt ) played together briefly as the Vendettas . They played mainly new Stacy-penned tracks , though Darryl Hunt also contributed songs , and the band 's live set included a few Pogues songs . First Ranken then Hunt left the band , the latter going on to become singer/songwriter in an indie band called Bish , whose self-titled debut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play with a number of other bands , including hKippers , The Municipal Waterboard and , most recently , The Mysterious Wheels . In addition to The Vendettas who Stacy freely admits lost all attraction when the Pogues reformed , Spider continued to write and record music with various bands , including the James Walbourne , Filthy Thieving Bastards , Dropkick Murphys and Astral Social Club . Shane MacGowan founded Shane MacGowan and The Popes in 1992 . They only managed two studio albums but struggled on until 2002 . His autobiography ' ' A Drink With Shane MacGowan ' ' , co-written with his journalist girlfriend Victoria Mary Clarke , was released in 2001 . Jem Finer went into experimental music , playing a big part in a project known as Longplayer , a piece of music designed to play continuously for 1,000 years without repeating itself . In 2005 , Finer released the album ' ' Bum Steer ' ' with DB Bob ( as DM Bob and Country Jem ) . James Fearnley moved to the United States shortly before leaving the Pogues .

Terry Woods formed The Bucks with Ron Kavana , releasing the album ' ' Dancin ' To The Ceili Band ' ' in 1994 . Later , he formed The Woods Band , releasing the album ' ' Music From The Four Corners of Hell ' ' in 2002. # Reunion # The band , including MacGowan , re-formed for a Christmas tour in 2001 and performed nine shows in the UK and Ireland in December 2004 . In 2002 ' ' Q ' ' magazine named The Pogues as one of the 50 Bands To See Before You Die . In July 2005 , the bandagain including MacGowanplayed at the annual Guilfest festival in Guildford before flying out to Japan where they played three dates . Japan is the last place they all played together before MacGowan was originally sacked in 1991 , and they have a strong following there . They played a date in Spain in early September . The reunited Pogues played dates in the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and re-released their 1987 Christmas classic Fairytale of New York on 19 December , which went straight in at No. 3 in the UK Singles charts on Christmas Day 2005 , showing the song 's enduring popularity . On 22 December 2005 the BBC broadcast a live performance ( recorded the previous week ) on the Jonathan Ross Christmas show with Katie Melua filling in for the late Kirsty MacColl , the first time the band had played the song live on television . The following week they performed live on the popular music show ' ' CD:UK ' ' . Shane MacGowan wrote a blog for ' ' The Guardian ' ' website in 2006 , detailing his thoughts on the current tour . The band was awarded the lifetime achievement award at the annual Meteor Ireland Music Awards in February 2006 . In March 2006 , the band played their first US dates with Shane in over 15 years . The band played a series of sold-out concerts in Washington , D.C. , Atlantic City , Boston , and New York . Later they played a series of highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Las Vegas , and Los Angeles , and toured Glasgow , Manchester , Birmingham , London , Dublin , and Nottingham in mid-December 2006 . They began a second US tour in March 2007 , once again to coincide ( and conclude ) with a Roseland Ballroom New York City show on Saint Patrick 's Day . 2007 has proved to be the most prolific year of touring since the reunion . A tour of the west coast of America and eleven dates in the UK in December complement the headlining festival appearances made in the summer across Europe ( Sweden , Belgium and Spain ) . They continue to be in huge demand , often selling out very large venues , despite criticism of selling out , and claims that arenas and festivals do not suit the band 's sound . Guitarist Phil Chevron has stated there were no plans to record new music or release a new album . Chevron said that one way to keep enjoying what they were doing was to avoid making a new album , although he did say that there still is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the near future . Terry Woods has commented that MacGowan has been writing , and most of it sounds good . In 2008 the band released a box set ' ' Just Look Them Straight in the Eye and Say .... POGUE MAHONE ! ! ' ' , which included rare studio out-takes and previously unreleased material . The band has received mixed reviews of some recent performances though they continue to pull the crowds . Reviewing a March 2008 concert , The ' ' Washington Post ' ' described MacGowan as puffy and paunchy , but said the singer still has a banshee wail to beat Howard Dean 's , and the singer 's abrasive growl is all a band this marvelous needs to give its amphetamine-spiked take on Irish folk a focal point . The reviewer continued : The set started off shaky , MacGowan singing of goin ' where streams of whiskey are flowin , ' and looking like he 'd arrived there already . He grew more lucid and powerful as the evening gathered steam , through two hours and 26 songs , mostly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In December 2010 the Pogues ( with support from Crowns ) played what was billed as a farewell UK Christmas tour . In March 2011 , the Pogues played a six-city/ten-show sold out US tour titled A Parting Glass with The Pogues visiting Chicago , Detroit , Baltimore , Washington , D.C. , Boston , and New York City ( in that order ) , with only the last three cities getting more than one show . It may , or may not , be the last time they tour the States . Stacy said I think we are basically pretty certain this is the last tour of this type we 'll be doing in the States . There might be the odd sort of one-off here and there . We 're not saying this is absolutely , definitely the end . In August 2012 , the Pogues embarked on a 30th Anniversary Summer 2012 8-city European Tour scheduled from 4 August 2012 at the Stockton Weekender Festival in Stockton-on-Tees , UK to 11 &amp; 12 September 2012 at L'Olympia , Paris , two shows filmed and recorded for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In March 2013 the Pogues released ' ' 30:30 : The Essential Collection ' ' , a 2-disc set featuring 30 songs along with eleven videos . In October 2013 , the Pogues released a box set titled ' ' Pogues 30 ' ' containing remastered versions of all of their studio albums plus a previously unreleased live album featuring Joe Strummer at the London Forum in December 1991 . Guitarist Philip Chevron died on 8 October 2013 in Dublin , Ireland from oesophageal cancer at age 56. # Members # ; Current members * Spider Stacy vocals , tin whistle <small> ( 19821996 , 2001present ) </small> * Jem Finer banjo , mandola , saxophone , hurdy-gurdy , guitar , vocals <small> ( 19821996 , 2001present ) </small> * James Fearnley accordion , mandolin , piano , guitar <small> ( 19821993 , 2001present ) </small> * Shane MacGowan vocals , guitar , banjo , bodhrn <small> ( 19821991 , 2001present ) </small> * Andrew Ranken drums , percussion , harmonica , vocals <small> ( 19821996 , 2001present ) </small> * Darryl Hunt bass guitar <small> ( 19861996 , 2001present ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar , vocals <small> ( 19861993 , 2001present ) </small> ;
