@@2961514 Antoine Augustin Calmet , O.S.B. ( 26 February 1672 25 October 1757 ) , a French Benedictine monk , was born at Mnil-la-Horgne , then in the Duchy of Bar , part of the Holy Roman Empire ( now the French department of Meuse , located in the region of Lorraine ) . Calmet was a pious monk as well as a learned man , and one of the most distinguished members of the Congregation of St. Vanne . In recognition of these qualities he was elected prior of Lay-Saint-Christophe in 1715 , Abbot of St-Lopold at Nancy in 1718 , and of Senones Abbey in 1729 . He was twice entrusted with the office of Abbot General of the congregation . Pope Benedict XIII wished to confer episcopal dignity upon him , but his humility could not be brought to accept the honour . Calmet was greatly admired by the philosopher Voltaire , who visited the abbey on several occasions . He died at Senones Abbey , in the Vosges , near Saint-Di , on 25 October 1757. # Work # # Comments on the Bible # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of Commercy , and in 1688 joined the same Order at the Abbey of Saint-Mansuy at Toul , where he was admitted to profession on the 23 October of the following year . After his ordination , 17 March 1696 , he was appointed to teach philosophy and theology at the Abbey of Moyenmoutier . Here , with the help of his brethren , he began to gather the material for his commentary of the Bible , which he completed at Munster in Alsace where he was sent in 1704 as sub-prior and professor of Biblical exegesis . The first volume appeared in Paris in 1707 with the title ' ' Commentaire littral sur tous les livres de l'Ancien et du Nouveau Testaments ' ' ( ' ' A literal Commentary on all the Books of the Old and New Testaments ' ' ) ; the last of the twenty-three quarto volumes , owing to various delays , was published only in 1716 . To satisfy the demand for the work a second edition in twenty-six volumes quarto was issued 17141720 , and a third , enlarged , edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work inaugurated a new method of exegesis . Its author departed from the custom of giving allegorical ( mystical ) and tropological ( moral ) interpretations besides the literal . The most valuable part of the commentary were the introductory prefaces to the several books and 114 learned dissertations on special topics . These he published separately with nineteen new ones in three volumes , under the title ' ' Dissertations qui peuvent servir de prolgomnes l ' criture Sainte ' ' ( Paris , 1720 ) . The collection met with such success that two editions were printed at Amsterdam in 1722 , the title being changed to ' ' Trsors d'antiquits sacres et profanes ' ' . It was translated into English ( Oxford , 1726 ) , Latin ( by Mansi , Lucca , 1729 ) , Dutch ( Rotterdam , 1728 ) , German ( Bremen , 1738,1744 , and 1747 ) and Italian . # Other works # In the meanwhile he had prepared two other works closely connected with Biblical exegesis : ( 1 ) ' ' Histoire de l'Ancien et du Nouveau Testament et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which went through several editions , and was translated into English ( London , 1740 ) , German ( Augsburg , 1759 ) and Latin ( ib. , 1788 ) ; ( 2 ) ' ' Dictionnaire historique , critique , chronologique , gographique et littral de la Bible ' ' ( Paris , 1720 , two vols. folio ) , a supplement ( also folio ) was added in 1728 . An improved and enlarged edition in four folio volumes was published in 1730 , which has several times been reprinted , the last time in Migne , ' ' Encyclopdie thologique ' ' , I-IV . It , too , was translated into Latin and the principal European languages . The English translation by D'Oyley and John Colson ( 1732 ) , revised and with additions by Taylor ( 1795 ) , went through many editions in a larger and compendious form . In his later years Calmet published some further Biblical dissertations in the ' ' Bible de Vence ' ' ( 1742 ) .
