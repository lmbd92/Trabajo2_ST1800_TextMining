@@22835514 James Thompson Marshall ( d. 1931 ) was a British railway and mechanical engineer known for inventing the ' Marshall valve gear ' for steam locomotive use . James Marshall began his engineering career at the Leeds-based Steam Plough Company , and later moved to the city 's Boyne Engine Works . # Marshall valve gear # J. T. Marshall invented and patented several different valve gears but these should not be confused with the Marshall valve gear patented by Marshall , Sons &amp; Co. in 1879 . At least one of J. T. Marshall 's valve gears was a rotary type and the only known application was to the Austrian BB Class 114 locomotive . The better-known J. T. Marshall gear was a modified Walschaerts valve gear which was first applied to a Great Northern Railway mineral locomotive , no. 743 , in 1901 and received a glowing report . Next , it was tried on GNR Class C2 No. 1520 in March 1903 . There was no external change visible on the locomotive as a result of this modification . When the valve gear was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of which gave lap and lead movement by swinging the link backwards and forwards on its suspension bracket . The other eccentric was set at 90 degrees to the crank and rocked the link by means of a bell crank on the hanging link pin . The position of the radius rod die pin in the link determined the direction of movement and the cutoff . Showing little advantage over the normal Stephenson link valve gear , it was removed from the C2 ' Atlantic ' in April 1907 to ease maintenance . A modified version of the gear ( for outside drive ) was tried on SECR N class no. 1850 in 1933-4 but , again , it was not a great success . # Patents # * 14242/1894 Improvements in steam engine valves and gear for working them , with Reginald Wigram .
