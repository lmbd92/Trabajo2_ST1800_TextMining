The intended specific target market for the Official Police was mainly law enforcement agencies and it became one of the best selling police firearms of all time , eventually in the 1950s coming to exemplify typical peace officer weaponry . The Official Police was also used by various U.S. and allied military forces during World War II . # Development and history # As the 20th Century began , the older .32 caliber revolvers which had been standard-issue for the majority of American police departments began to be phased out in favor of the larger-bore .38 caliber . In 1908 Colt introduced a sleek and modernized revolver they dubbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ) and popular .38 Special quickly became the issue service revolver of many departments . During the same period , revolvers began to fall out of favor with the U.S. Military , especially after the adoption on the U.S. Model of 1911 semi-automatic pistol . As military sales of their revolvers dropped off , Colt searched for an alternative market and realized the popularity and strong sales of their product line with civilian law enforcement agencies could form their replacement market . By 1927 the overwhelming sales of two popular models , the Army Special and Colt Police Positive , had assured Colts dominance of the law enforcement firearms market . Colts marketing strategy was further fine-tuned by making a few superficial alterations to the Army Special revolver and then renaming it as the Official Police model . The changes included adding checkering to the trigger and cylinder latch , matting the topstrap of the frame and widening the rear sight groove . Colt also upgraded the quality of the guns finish from a dull blued finish to a highly polished blued surface . In 1930 , Colt scored a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could easily handle the firing of heavily-loaded .38 rounds intended for competitor Smith &amp; Wesson 's new large N-frame revolver , the .38-44 , none of the comparable S&amp;W revolvers could manage this feat . By 1933 the Colt sales catalog listed many law enforcement agencies as having adopted the OP as a sidearm , including the New York City , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Kansas City police departments . In addition many state police organizations and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation chose the OP as their issue revolver . The U.S. Army also bought some of the revolvers , issuing them to military police and to federal agencies in need of a revolver for their armed agents , such as the Treasury Department , Coast Guard , and the Postal Inspection Service . Many Official Police revolvers were also bought by the police forces and militaries of various South American countries . Between May 1940 and June 1941 , 49,764 Official Police revolvers in .38 New Police or .38/200 caliber were purchased by the British Purchasing Commission and shipped to the United Kingdom for use by British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These revolvers bore British military acceptance markings and had a 5 barrel ; the butt was fitted with a military-style lanyard ring . Most of these OP revolvers were assembled from commercial-grade parts made before 1942 . When the U.S. became involved in World War II , the U.S. government requested contracts to supply .38 revolvers required for arming security personnel charged with the security of government buildings , shipyards , and defense plant installations against sabotage or theft . Commencing in 1941 , small quantities of the .38 Colt Official Police were procured directly from the Defense Supplies Corporation ( DSC ) . When government purchasing officials objected to production delays of the OP , as well as the unit cost , Colt responded by simplifying the gun . Savings were achieved by eliminating all unnecessary exterior polishing operations , substituting a smooth-face trigger and hammer , and fitting the gun with simplified checkered wood grips with the Colt medallion ; the latter was soon replaced by ' Coltwood ' molded plastic grips . Instead of the normal bluing , the revolver was given a dull parkerized finish . Dubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was primarily used to arm units of Military police , security guards at U.S. defense plant installations and shipyards , as well as limited clandestine issue to agencies involved in overseas espionage and military intelligence . In mid-1942 the Springfield Ordnance District ( SOD ) was given control over procurement and distribution of the Commando , which transferred the revolvers to the end user . A few Commandos were shipped to the U.S. Maritime Commission and used as small arms equipment on U.S. merchant ships and ships provided to the Allies under Lend-Lease . Most Commando wartime production went to the Defense Supplies Corporation ( DSC ) . for use by security and police forces , while approximately 1,800 Commandos were used by the U.S. Navy , with another 12,800 revolvers distributed to various military intelligence agencies . Control over procurement changed in 1944 , after the DSC formally objected to being charged additional handling fees by the armed forces , and was then authorized to procure the Commando directly from Colt . After the Allied victory , Colt resumed commercial production and returned to the prewar polished blued finish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 when the checkered wooden grips were reintroduced . During the postwar period , Colt fell on difficult financial times and the company introduced few new models . At Smith &amp; Wesson , both output and new model civilian and police sales improved , and the sales margin gap between the two corporations progressively tightened . Finally in the 1960s S&amp;W took over the lead . A contributing factor to this change may have been Smith &amp; Wesson 's generally lower cost per unit , accompanied by a double-action trigger pull on their military &amp; police model that was preferred by many agencies teaching the new combat-oriented double-action revolver training . Colt announced the discontinuation of the Official Police in 1969 , stating that competitive production of the design was no longer economically feasible . With a total production of over 400,000 pistols , the Official Police ranks as one of the most successful handguns ever made . # Features # The Official Police was machined of fine carbon steel , with bright royal Colt blued as well as nickel plated finishes , and was offered in 4 , 5and6 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was manufactured in a variety of chamberings including .22 LR , .32-20 ( discontinued in 1942 ) , .41 Long Colt ( discontinued in 1938 ) , and the most common and popular , the .38 Special . Colts Positive Lock firing pin block safety was a standard feature of the revolver , preventing the firing pin from striking the primer unless the trigger was deliberately pulled . The pistols sights consisted of a blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight , which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolvers top strap . The top strap had a matte finish to reduce glare down the sight plane . # Variants # # Commando # The Commando was a wartime variant of the Official Police , manufactured with either a two or four inch barrel , and incorporating several production economies including a non-gloss Parkerized finish .

Of this total , approximately 12,800 Commando revolvers were issued to various intelligence services such as US Military intelligence and the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) . Many of the latter were procured with the two-inch barrel , referred to as the Junior Commando . Regular production deliveries of two-inch Junior Commando revolvers began in March 1943 , at approximately serial number 9,000 . More than 12,000 of the two-inch Commandos encountered today are actually postwar conversions from four-inch models produced during the war . # Marshal # A rare variant featuring a rounded grip , with barrel lengths of two and four inches .
