He was instrumental in helping Inuit obtain surnames rather than disc numbers . He was also the first Inuk to sit on what is now the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories and worked with Thomas Berger . # Early life # Okpik ( the name means Snowy Owl in Inuvialuktun ) , an Inuvialuit , was born in the Mackenzie Delta area of the Northwest Territories , near Aklavik at a summer fishing camp . As a youth he , like many other Aboriginal people , contracted tuberculosis and was sent to the Charles Camsell Hospital in Edmonton .

In 1965 Okpik was appointed to the Northwest Territories Council ( 5th Northwest Territories Legislative Council ) . At that time most of the council were from Ottawa .

He was not re-appointed to council after Simonie Michael was elected to the council in the 1967 general election . The government of Canada felt that Michael would serve Okpik 's intended role and gave his seat to Chief John Tetlichi the first status Indian to serve on council . # Project Surname # Since the 1940s the Government of Canada had used disc numbers to identify Inuit due to the lack of need in historical times for surnames . In the mid 60s the Northwest Territories Council undertook to replace the disc numbers with last names under Project Surname . Okpik , whose disc number was W3-554 , was picked to head the project . From 1968 until 1971 he visited every community , as well as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Nunavut and Nunavik in northern Quebec .
