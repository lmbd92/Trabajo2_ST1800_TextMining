Compared to the other professional wrestling organizations of the time , such as the New Japan Pro Wrestling and the Universal Wrestling Federation ( Japan ) , Shooto was aimed at having no predetermined results . The first amateur event was held in 1986 and the first professional event in 1989 . The Shooto organization hosted the ' ' Vale Tudo Japan ' ' tournament in the summer of 1994 . Previously to this tournament , Shooto did not feature punches to the face in a ground position , but after seeing effective usage of punching by foreign participants , Sayama decided to incorporate these striking techniques into shooto . In April 1996 , ' ' World Shooto ' ' , the ' ' Shooto Association ' ' and the ' ' International Shooto Commission ' ' were formed . This marked the end of Shooto as a single organization , and turned it into a combat sport with governing bodies . Since establishment of ISC , the champions of Shooto are called World Champion .

Previous to 2009 , Shooto 's rules included a knockdown rule giving knocked down fighters an eight-count to recover as well as allowing strikes to the back of the head . Shooto had argued that the potential for a knocked out ( and thus unconscious ) fighter to receive unnecessary damage while on the ground necessitated the rule , but with Shooto being one of the lone organizations still having the rule , consideration of the potential for injury allowing a knocked down fighter time to recover thus allowing additional blows , and with the original vision of Shooto 's founder being a synthesis of striking , throwing and submitting - the rulechange was instituted in mid-2008 . The disallowment of strikes to the back of the head was done for similar medical reasons . # Techniques and strategies # The aim in a shooto match is to defeat the opponent by a knockout or a submission , but fights can also end in a referee stoppage or by a judge decision .
