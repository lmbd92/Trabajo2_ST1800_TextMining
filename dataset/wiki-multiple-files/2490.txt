@@21157514 Biodiversity banking , also known as biodiversity trading or conservation banking , is a process by which biodiversity loss can be reduced by creating a framework which allows biodiversity to be reliably measured , and market based solutions applied to improving biodiversity . Biodiversity banking provides a means to place a monetary value on ecosystem services . In the United States a mitigation banking process applies to impacts on wetlands . It requires that developers firstly avoid harm to wetlands , but if harm is considered unavoidable , then wetland habitat of similar function and values must be protected , enhanced or restored to compensate for those that will be damaged . The process comes under the US Clean Water Act 1972 the US Army Corps of Engineers regulations and the commitment to no net loss of wetlands habitat . Since about 2000 the term species banking , sometimes called conservation banking , has applied to impacts on species of special concern , typically those that are listed by state and federal agencies under the U.S. Endangered Species Act or its state-based equivalent . Similar to wetlands banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed species or their habitat , ensuring a similar no net loss policy for these biodiversity resources . Compensation for impacts to a stream riparian zone may also be required in relation to the linear distance of lost stream functions resulting from stream bank structures ( e.g. , concrete or rip rap ) , sedimentation , channelization , dredging or similar activities . Two biodiversity banking schemes operating in Australia are the New South Wales BioBanking scheme , which commenced in 2008 , and the Victorian Native Vegetation Management Framework scheme . Both schemes apply particularly to developers , where biodiversity values will be reduced through land clearing and building development . The framework requires developers to source biodiversity credits through a market mechanism to offset biodiversity loss . Listed species , critical habitat , wetlands and stream habitat are all components of biodiversity ecosystem services . Taken collectively , they may be referred to as biodiversity banks . # See also # *Biodiversity *Mitigation banking *Conservation in Australia *Environmental issues in Australia *Economics of biodiversity *Ecosystem services *Satoyama *Biodiversity offsetting # References # # Further reading # *
