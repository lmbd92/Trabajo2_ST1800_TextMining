@@8755514 ' ' A Walk Around the Hotel Courtyard , Acatln ' ' is a 1985 painting by British artist David Hockney . Hockney painted ' ' A Walk Around the Hotel Courtyard ' ' after discovering a hotel courtyard in Mexico , when car trouble forced him to stop on the way while driving to Mexico City . The painting is one of his more hotly coloured works , being mostly red , with green and yellow , and is done in reverse perspective . The oil on two canvases or a diptych measures 183x610 centimeters overall . It is owned by the Benesse Corporation and is currently on display at Benesse House and Art Site , a contemporary art museum and hotel at the art village of Noashima , Japan . # The studies # The courtyard inspired a set of drawings , later a series of lithographs and finally the painting . In these works , at first the perspective is conventional , and concentrates on the central well , observing points of view from walking the courtyard .

There is cubism , scientific objectivity is gone , and plurality of space is emphasized . Reverse perspective is used to produce an all-seeing experience leading to a visionary feeling . Like a frame around paintings which decorate an altar , it seems to amalgamate real space with the world of the miracle . In his review of the show , ' ' Espace/Paysage ' ' , Galerie Sud , Centre Georges Pompidou , in Paris , Joe Lockard observed that the space of the landscape in Hockneys other paintings is successfully extended to an interior . He says , Hockney attempts and achieves panoramic interior compositions that distinguish his vivid experimentalism . The painting followed Hockneys Mexican exhibition , ' ' Hockney Paints the Stage ' ' in 1984.
