Legend says there was a Kingdom of Sobrarbe , where a cross appeared upon a tree . It became part of the County of Aragon , but in the early 9th century was held for five years by Amrus ibn Yusuf , the governor of Zaragoza , being retaken after his death . Sobrarbe was joined to the County of Ribagorza in the early 10th century through marriage to an heiress . However , in the late 10th and early 11th century , a series of incursions from the south left it disorganized and depopulated , and for a time it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great of Navarre , who reconquered the region in 1015 , similarly extending his power into Ribagorza over the subsequent years . Whatever hereditary claim might have existed was subsequently brought to Sancho through his wife Mayor of Castile , heiress to the Ribagorza counts . Sancho divided the territories he had united , and his third son , Gonzalo , was given the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza . After the death of Gonzalo in 1038 , his illegitimate half-brother Ramiro I of Aragon brought Sobrarbe and Ribagorza into his hands , creating the nucleus of the Kingdom of Aragon. # Municipalities # Abizanda , Ansa-Sobrarbe , Brcabo , Bielsa , Boltaa , Broto , Fanlo , Fiscal , La Fueva , Gistan , Labuerda , Laspua , Palo , Plan , Purtolas , El Pueyo de Aragus , San Juan de Plan , Tella-Sin , Torla
