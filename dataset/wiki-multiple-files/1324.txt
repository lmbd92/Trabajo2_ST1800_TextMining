Odakyu started service on the first section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It expanded to Tama Center , the central station of Tama New Town , on April 23 , 1975 . This section was constructed by the national Japan Railway Construction Corporation , since renamed the Japan Railway Construction , Transport and Technology Agency ( JRTT ) , while Odakyu operated it and paid for the organization . On March 27 , 1990 , Odakyu opened Karakida station . The line was constructed on double track , but Odakyu could not take a large part of the transport between Tokyo and Tama New Town . Delay of the quadrupling of the main Odawara Line due to long standing land acquisition conflicts prevented operating extra trains that were to connect the new town and the terminus of Shinjuku . Rapid train service on the Tama Line began in 2000 , and succeeded in increasing the number of passengers , shorting transit time . # Rapid service # ; ( LE ) : Down from Shinjuku , only in evenings , none to Shinjuku .
