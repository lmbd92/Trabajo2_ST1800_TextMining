@@18572514 other=CTA and Pace buses OaktonSkokie is a rapid transit station on the Chicago Transit Authority 's Yellow Line , which serves Skokie 's downtown . Previously , a station existed at this location which was in operation as part of the CTA 's Niles Center Route from 1925 until 1948 , and later demolished in 1964 . The current station opened on April 30 , 2012. # History # In the 1920s , both the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the North Shore Line ( an interurban railroad linking Chicago and Milwaukee ) existed under the private ownership of Samuel Insull . The North Shore Line 's original route to Milwaukee ran through numerous North Shore communities that had become densely settled . In order to provide faster service between Chicago and Milwaukee , the North Shore Line decided to build a high-speed bypass several miles west of its original line . The new route would traverse the Skokie Valley and converge with the ' L ' at Howard . In an attempt to encourage development in the village of Niles Center on the southern portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit service as far as Dempster Street . The new Niles Center Route included several intermediate stations served only by the Chicago Rapid Transit Company , including one at Oakton Street , just a few blocks from the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and Oakton Street where the business district of Niles Center was forming . Arthur U. Gerber , staff architect for Samuel Insull , designed the station in the Prairie School style , similar to the Dempster station at the end of the line . The station at Oakton was smaller and set between the tracks , with a single high-level island platform projecting from the rear of the station house . The line entered operation on March 28 , 1925 , but did not encourage much development before the Great Depression and World War II put a halt to building activity for nearly 20 years . The Niles Center service remained unprofitable in 1947 when the privately owned Chicago Rapid Transit Company was subsumed into the public Chicago Transit Authority , and on March 27 , 1948 , rapid transit service was terminated and replaced with the #97 Skokie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , except for Dempster where North Shore Line service continued until the company went out of business in 1963 . On Monday , April 20 , 1964 , the Chicago Transit Authority reinstated service on the Niles Center Branch as a nonstop shuttle between Howard and Dempster , dubbed the Skokie Swift . No station was located at Oakton , even though it is only one block from Skokie 's central business district . # Reconstruction # Since the Swift began operating in 1964 , there has been interest on the part of the Village of Skokie and its citizens to reestablish at least one of the local stations . The most likely candidate to return was Oakton because of its location near Skokie 's downtown and its potential to generate the most traffic . A study commissioned by the Village of Skokie and completed in Fall 2003 recommended establishing a stop at Oakton . Village officials discussed and planned for a downtown Skokie Swift station for more than five years . More recently , # Style and design # In early 2005 , the village received $417,000 in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers about 80 percent of design costs for the station . The village would pick up the remainder , about $104,000 , according to Village Director of Engineering Fred Schattner . Then , in mid-2005 , village staff submitted a grant proposal to the federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality grant program , which provides funds for projects that contribute to traffic congestion relief and cleaner air quality . In late November 2005 , the Skokie secured a $1 million federal grant for the village 's downtown Skokie Swift project with the help of U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D-9th . Then , in early December 2005 , Skokie learned they would receive an additional $9.2 million in federal grant funds to construct the station . The entire project is estimated to cost about $15 million including any land acquisition needed , which means the village had by this time secured more than two-thirds of the funding . Skokie Mayor Van Dusen has said he is exploring options to help pay for some or all of the remaining cost . # Location # The station is located on the site of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of Oakton Street and adjacent to the new Illinois Science + Technology Park . The village sought proposals from firms for design work for the new station , eventually awarding the contract to McDonough Associates . Construction of the new downtown station was expected to begin in 2007 and officials estimated the station would be completed in 2007 or 2008 . Issues of financing delayed the project as various funding sources were secured , and later issues of land acquisition delayed the project further . Finally in 2007 after extensive deliberation , the Village of Skokie initiated eminent domain proceedings against two landowners ( an auto repair shop and a truck rental business ) to make room adjacent to the station for a kiss and ride area , a bus turnaround and a taxi drop-off area . A groundbreaking ceremony took place at the adjacent Illinois Science + Technology Park on June 21 , 2010 . On June 8 , 2011 , the Chicago Transit Board revealed that the name of the station would be ' ' OaktonSkokie ' ' . Naming of the station was done concurrently with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Facilities # The station consists of an island platform at grade level located between the Yellow Line 's two tracks ; the eastern track serves trains to Dempster-Skokie , while the western track serves trains to Howard . OaktonSkokie has two entrances : one will located off of Oakton Street , the other off Skokie Boulevard near Searle Parkway . # Bus connections # CTA Buses * <nowiki> #54A North Cicero/Skokie Blvd. </nowiki> * <nowiki> #97 Skokie </nowiki> Pace Buses * <nowiki> #210 Lincoln Avenue </nowiki> * <nowiki> #226 Oakton Street ( 3 blocks west ) </nowiki>
