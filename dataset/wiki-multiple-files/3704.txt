@@34832514 Melvin Lawrence Ember ( January 13 , 1933 September 27 , 2009 ) was an American cultural anthropologist and cross-cultural researcher with wide-ranging interests who combined an active research career with writing for nonprofessionals. # Biography # Drawn to anthropology after reading the works of Margaret Mead , he attended Columbia University at the young age of 16 where he was further inspired by Elman Service and Morton Fried in the anthropology department ( B.A. 1953 ) . He then went on to Yale University to study for his Ph.D . in anthropology ( received 1958 ) , primarily under the mentorship of George Peter Murdock . After a years postdoctoral work at Yale , Ember spent four years at the Laboratory of Socio-Environmental Studies at the National Institute of Health ( 19591962 ) . He was professor at Antioch College ( 19631967 ) and Hunter College ( 19671987 ) . He also chaired the department of anthropology at Hunter College of the City University of New York ( 19671973 ) . Here he succeeded in expanding the department significantly , attracting young scholars from major institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York graduate program in anthropology from 1973 to 1975 . He was president of the Society for Cross-Cultural Research in 1981-1982 and in 1982 took over the editorship of Cross-Cultural Research , a position he held until the time of his death . He moved to the New Haven area in 1987 to become president of the Human Relations Area Files ( HRAF ) , an institution at Yale whose mission is to foster the comparative study of culture . Under his leadership , he helped revitalize the institution , moving its databases into the digital age . # Work # # Fieldwork # In contrast to most cultural anthropologists at the time , who conducted their fieldwork in a single community , Ember 's fieldwork in American Samoa was explicitly comparative , using community variation to test theories about culture change . He chose three communities differing in distance from the commercial center to evaluate how commercial involvement affected political change . His assessment of Samoan kinship was subsequently challenged by Derek Freeman , long before the now-famous MeadFreeman controversy about Samoa . Because Ember knew , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Samoa , he questioned how Freeman , working in a very different time and in Western Samoa , could doubt Meads veracity . # National Institute of Mental Health # At the National Institute of Mental Health Embler worked on the universality of the familial incest taboo . Since all societies prohibit familial incest , he decided to focus on cross-cultural variation in cousin marriage to try to understand why some societies allowed close cousin marriages while others forbade it . After evaluating the various explanatory hypotheses of the time , his own empirical research confirmed that much of the variation in cousin marriage could best be explained as an adaptation to the harmful effects of inbreeding . # Cross-cultural work # As a professor at Antioch College and Hunter College Ember continued his cross-cultural work on aspects of kinship and social organization , picking up first on topics that Murdock was unable to explain , such as variation in post-marital residence and unilineal descent . Traditional theories had focused on economic factors , such as which gender contributed most to the economy , but finding these explanations lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly the effects of warfare in the social environment . Because warfare seemed so central in explaining various aspects of social organization , he then turned to research that tested ideas about why societies varied in type and frequency of violence , looking at variation in warfare frequency , homicide , and corporal punishment of children in the anthropological record . Believing that laws about human nature should hold true among technological complex as well as simpler societies , he persuaded political scientist Bruce Russett to join him and his wife Carol R. Ember in a project to test the theory that democracies do not fight each other . Although the concepts of democracy and international war had to be transformed to fit the anthropological record , the results of their collaborative research were consistent with many studies conducted by political scientists . Ember later worked with cross-cultural psychologists to explore the relationships between aggression and war . # Interdisciplinary research # Branching out into diverse and interdisciplinary research areas was not unusual for Ember . Indeed , he published scholarly articles in archaeology , linguistics , biological anthropology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different anthropologists in far-flung places and across time could be used to test theories about why cultures varied or were similar and he devoted most of his research career to systematically testing explanations , rather than just expounding them . His passion for systematic comparative research on challenging questions in all areas of anthropology influenced a generation of younger scholars through his direction of the first Summer Institute for Cross-Cultural Research in 1964 , his active participation in NSF-funded Summer Institutes in Comparative Research between 1991 and 1999 , and through the series of publications in comparative methods that resulted from these Institutes . # Publications # Ember is widely known as the co-author of two major textbooks , ' ' Anthropology ' ' ( with Carol R. Ember and Peter N. Peregrine , Prentice-Hall ) , and ' ' Cultural Anthropology ' ' ( with Carol R. Ember , Prentice-Hall ) , first published in 1973 and now in their 13th edition ( 2011 ) . He was also editor or co-editor of eight encyclopedias.
