They appear before Charles Forbin and his friend Edward Blake in the form of two black spheres , and quickly demonstrate vast intellect and powers of transformation and telepathy . After immobilizing Blake , they explain to Forbin their purpose in immobilizing Colossus their desire to take half of the Earth 's oxygen , a process that will kill nearly a quarter of the human population . In order to proceed with construction of the Collector designed to harvest the oxygen , the Martians reactivate the parts of Colossus necessary to manage human society . Though having no other option but to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an alternative . He discovers in conversation with the Martians that their need for the oxygen is driven by the threat of radiation emanating from the Crab Nebula , which will kill the Martians without the protection of an oxygenated atmosphere . As construction of the Collector proceeds , a humbled Blake proposes to Forbin that the old Colossus the parent of the crippled system , be reactivated . With little other alternative , Forbin agrees . Construction equipment controlled by Colossus soon completes work on the Collector . An initial five-minute test of the device proves enormously destructive . With a second , final test imminent , Blake travels to Colorado with Angela , Forbin 's private secretary . Racing against time , Blake and a small team of workers succeeds in penetrating the mountain where the old Colossus is located and re-activating the computer , only to discover that , once imputed with the facts of the situation , Colossus argues that the collection program is in the best interests of humans ' long-term future and should move forward .
