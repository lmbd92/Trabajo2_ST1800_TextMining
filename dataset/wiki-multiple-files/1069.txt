@@5768514 latest preview version = BitPim is an open source program designed for managing content on CDMA devices . Most mobile phones using a Qualcomm-manufactured CDMA chipset are supported . The program is also cross-platform , operating on the Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux operating systems . Although BitPim might be taken for a personal information manager ( PIM ) , its name derives from bitpym , a suggestion generated by a pronouncable-password generator ; the y being replaced with an i simply to eliminate ambiguity in pronunciation . Earlier , the program had been named Entrocul by the same method . # Features # Functionalities vary on the model of the device . The following managing functions are currently supported by BitPim : * Phone Book * Calendar * Wallpapers * Ringtones * Filesystem * Media * Memo * Todo * Call history * SMS * T9 editor Data can be imported and exported from various sources such as Microsoft Outlook and Google Calendar . # Implementation # BitPim is implemented using the Python programming language with various pieces in C to access hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wxWidgets . That gives a native look and feel on each platform . Most of the functionality is obtained by using the diagnostics mode available in Qualcomm Mobile Station Modem ( MSM ) used by virtually every manufacturer of CDMA phones . The diagnostics mode provides direct access to the embedded filesystem in the phone . The remainder of the functionality is via protocols provided by the handset manufacturers , but these usually only cover updating the phonebook . Because the sizes of fields in the protocols differ between every model ( even from the same handset manufacturer ) and even between the same model offered at different carriers , BitPim has code and field descriptions for every model . A big part of each approximately monthly release is adding support for new phone models .
