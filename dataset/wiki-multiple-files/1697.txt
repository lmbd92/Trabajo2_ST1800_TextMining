' ' Water supply and sanitation in Jamaica is characterized by high levels of access to an improved water source , while access to adequate sanitation stands at only 80% . This situation affects especially the poor , including the urban poor many of which live in the country 's over 595 unplanned squatter settlements in unhealthy and unsanitary environments with a high risk of waterborne disease . Despite a number of policy papers that were mainly focused on water supply and despite various projects funded by external donors , increases in access have remained limited ( 1% for water and 5% for sanitation between 1990 and 2004 ) . The responsibility for water and sanitation policies within the government rests with the Ministry of Water and Housing , and the main service provider is the National Water Commission . An autonomous regulatory agency , the Office of Utilities Regulation , approves tariffs and establishes targets for efficiency increases . # Access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHO/UNICEF ( /2006 ) . Data for and based on the Survey of Living Conditions ( 2002 ) . In urban areas , where 52% of Jamaicas population lives , access to improved water supply is 98% access to improved sanitation is 91% . Only 31% of the urban population is connected to sewers . In rural areas access stands at 88% for improved water supply and 69% for improved sanitation . Overall , access to improved water supply in Jamaica stands at 93% and access to improved sanitation is currently at 80% . Between 1990 and 2004 access only increased slightly by 1% for water by 5% for sanitation. # Service quality # Many homes receive water only at low pressure . Many rural communities receive water that is not or only irregularly chlorinated . According to the 2011 Population and Housing Census , 69 percent of Jamaica 's households receive untreated drinking water . The following table summarizes the results of the water tested from the 11 major surface sources and 6 wells of the National Water Commission ( NWC ) as compared to the standards set by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' : Office of Utilities Regulation Annual Report 2005-2006 , p. 48 Most of the country 's over 595 unplanned squatter settlements or approximately 10% of the population is located nearby unhealthy and unsanitary environments without piped water or sanitation where there is a high risk of waterborne diseases . The vulnerability to natural disasters threatens the existing water and sanitation systems . Furthermore , there is a heightened probability of contamination of systems following hurricanes due to service interruption as well as the incidence of health-related diseases . # Infrastructure # The National Water Commission ( NWC ) , which produces more than 90% of Jamaica 's total potable water supply , operates a network of more than 160 wells , over 116 river sources ( via water treatment plants ) and 147 springs . The various Parish Councils and a small number of private water companies supply the rest of the potable water . The NWC operates more than 1,000 water supply and over 100 sewerage facilities islandwide . These vary from large raw water storage reservoirs at Hermitage and Mona in St. Andrew and the Great River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small diesel-driven pumping installations serving rural towns and villages across Jamaica . The NWC facilities also include over 4,000 kilometres of pipelines and more than 500 kilometres of sewer mains across the island . NWC supplies some 190 million gallons of potable water each day . # Responsibility for water supply and sanitation # # Policy and regulation # Policy institutions The Ministry of Water and Housing ( MWH ) is responsible for setting water and sanitation policies . It is also in charge of ensuring that all housing developments meet required standards for sanitation . The Ministry of Health develops and implements health policies and legislation to promote appropriate sanitation practices ; establishes and monitors health indicators for sanitation , enforces public health laws , provides public education on sanitation and hygiene . The National Environment and Planning Agency ( NEPA ) determines and monitors environmental standards for water supply and sanitation . Local Authorities have only a limited role in the sector . The following water agencies operate under the supervision of the Ministry of Water and Housing * The National Water Commission , in charge water supply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineering Corporation Limited ( CECL ) * The Water Resource Authority The Water Resources Authority ( WRA ) is responsible for the management , protection , and controlled allocation and use of Jamaica 's water resources . The WRA maintains a hydrological database and provides data , information , and technical assistance to government and non-government institutions . Policies Some of the existing policies related to water supply and sanitation are : * The Water Sector Policy Paper ( 1999 ) outlines the current situation and problems within the water sector , defines the objectives of the Government to address the issues , and sets out the mode of implementation . * The National Solid Waste Management Policy ( 2000 ) establishes the framework for standard setting and regulatory agency , the National Solid Waste Management Authority which facilitates the private sector as the principal service provider . The policy also indicates cost recovery provision as key , establishments of sanitary landfills , and solid waste management . * The draft National sanitation policy for Jamaica of 2005 notes that there are overlapping responsibilities at the national and local levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community-based organizations , community members , as well as the government . * The Water Sector Policy , Strategy and Action Plan ( 2004 ) has as its main objective to ensure that all households have access to water by 2010 , sewer all major towns by 2020 , as well as rehabilitate existing non-compliant facilities to achieve compliance with national environmental standards . * The Rural Water Supply Master Plan , announced in 2008 , is currently under elaboration . Regulation The Office of Utilities Regulation ( OUR ) , established by an Act of Parliament in 1995 , regulates , among others , water and sanitation service provision . The Office approves tariffs , sets targets for efficiency improvements , processes all license applications for utility services and makes recommendations to the Minister . # Service provision # Water service on the island is provided by one large public entity and three small private companies : * The National Water Commission ( NWC ) is the main institution responsible for all major water and sewerage operations , including : production of water and collection , treatment and disposal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NWC and the Parish Councils . * The smaller private service providers are : Four Rivers Development , Runaway Bay Water Co. , Rio Bueno Water Co , among others . The three provide 10-year non-exclusive licenses . Sanitation services are provided by NWC , Can Cara Development Company and Rosehall Utilities Company . # Other # The Jamaica Social Investment Fund finances community-based water and sanitation projects . # Economic efficiency # The water and sanitation infrastructure is inadequate and inefficiently operated , as the level of Non-revenue water for the NWC was 66% in 2005 . In 2004 , service providers produced 277 million cubic meters of water , but only 103 million cubic meters were consumed . # Financial aspects # # Tariffs and cost recovery # Cost recovery Despite a tariff increase granted to NWC in 2004 , the utility continued to register an operating loss for the fourth consecutive year . There thus is no cost recovery for capital costs . Poor enforcement of tariff payments contributes to the utility 's low revenues . Whenever tariffs are adjusted , the NWC and the OUR shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through water conservation . Affordability The average Jamaican household spends 2.1% of its income on water services . This is approximately half of what the average household spend on electricity , and a bit less than half of what the average household spends on telephone services . The poorest 20% of household in Jamaica spend 3.2% of their income on water , while the richest 20% send 1.8% of their income on water . # Investment and Financing # Most financing is provided through government grants to NWC , which are in turn financed by external loans , internal debt or general tax revenue . The government intends to tap other sources of financing , such as property taxes ( called millage ) and private sector financing . The Water Sector Policy Paper of 1999 estimated investment needs until 2015 at US$2.2 billion , including US$1.3 billion for the non-agricultural sector , US$0.3 billion for the agricultural sector and US$0.6 billion for sewerage systems . # External cooperation # The main external cooperation partners that provide support to the Jamaican government for water supply and sanitation are the Inter-American Development Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Inter-American Development Bank # * Kingston Metro Water Supply Rehabilitation Approved on June 23 , 2004 , a US$40 million loan aims to improve water and sanitation as well as to modernize the management in Kingston , Jamaica .
