For ground directed bombing ( GDB ) , an operator would manually plot a target on the Blind Bombing Plotting Sheet , then use the manual E6B computer and bombing tables to plot the release point for striking the target , after which a radar operator used the MPQ to acquire a track of the bomber near an initial point during which allowed ground control of the bomb run to the release point . Based on the WWII SCR-584 radar developed by MIT and which was used for the SCR-584-M missile control Receiver and beacon , the MPQ-2 included an RC-294 Plotter and its analog computer for converting radar range , azimuth , and elevation to cartesian coordinates , as well as a plotting board for drawing the aircraft track . The AN/MPQ-2 was the basis for the Rome Air Development Center 's AN/MSQ-1 &amp; -2 Close Support Control Sets also used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for command guidance of the Matador missile . # Locations # Radar Bomb Scoring detachments of the Colorado Springs ' 206th Army Air Force Base Unit ( organized on June 6 , 1945 ) used MPQ-2s at Kansas City and Fort Worth Army Airfield and in 1946 , the 4th launch of a V-2 at White Sands Proving Ground ( 1946 ) was tracked by two MPQ-2s . In addition to the CONUS RBS detachments ( e.g. , Detachments C , K , &amp; N ) , Detachment 23 's AN/MPQ-2 was at the Heston Radar Bomb Scoring Site on November 10 , 1950 , and after deployment to the Korean War , the three AN/MPQ-2 radars of the 3903rd Radar Bomb Scoring Group RBS detachments were transferred in January 1951 under the operational control of the 502nd Tactical Control Group ( TCG ) . The MPQ-2 guided Martin B-26 Marauders against enemy positions in front of the 25th Infantry Division . , and On February 23 , 1951 , the 1st Boeing B-29 Superfortress mission controlled by an MPQ-2 was flown ,
