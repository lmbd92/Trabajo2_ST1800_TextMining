Thats pretty much a flying giant in the sky thats twice as big as anything that can fly today . In fact , the bird , Pelagornis sandersi , is so ginormous that it exceeds our estimates for the limits of powered flight . With a 7.46m wingspan , the Grumman American AA-1 was as big as the Pelagornis sandersi . Discover says that P. sandersis size challenges the ideas we have about powered flight . The bigger the bird , the more power it needs to fly . But knowing that birds as big as P. sandersi can fly basically re-writes our idea of how big we think flying birds can get . P. sandersi covered the sky around 25 million to 28 million years ago and had paper-thin hollow bones , stumpy legs and huge wings all indicators of flight . Researchers used a computer program to estimate big birds flight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of reaching speeds up to 40 mph . Live Science explains : The model suggested the bird was an incredibly efficient glider , whose long , slender wings helped it stay aloft despite its enormous size . It was probably too big to take off simply by flapping its wings and launching itself into the air from a standstill instead , like Argentavis , P. sandersi may have gotten off the ground by running downhill into a headwind or taking advantage of air gusts to get aloft , much like a hang glider . Todays largest living flying bird is the royal albatross , which has a wingspan of about 3.5m . Thats a baby compared to P. sandersi . As for the previous worlds largest flying bird , the Argentavis a distant relative of todays Andean condor was estimated to have a 7m wingspan . But that has always been in dispute , explained Live Science , as only one wing bone of the Argentavis has ever been found .
