@@13041514 Neocatastrophism is the hypothesis that life-exterminating events such as gamma-ray bursts have acted as a galactic regulation mechanism in the Milky Way upon the emergence of complex life in its habitable zone . It is proposed as an explanation of Fermi 's paradox since it provides a mechanism which would have delayed the otherwise expected advent of intelligent beings in the local galaxy nearby to Earth . This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected by humans . # The problem # It is estimated that Earth-like planets in the Milky Way started forming 9 Gya BP , and that their median age is 6.4 0.7 Gya . Moreover , 75% of stars in the galactic habitable zone are older than the Sun . This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ( 4.54 Gya ) . This creates an observational dilemma since interstellar travel , ( even of the slow kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology ) could in theory , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy . This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist Enrico Fermi in his namesake paradox : Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here ? # The neocatastrophism resolution # Astrobiological evolution is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology . These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the galactic habitable zone . The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts . Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that stellar evolution produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the window in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age . According to modeling , this creates the possibility of a phase shift at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead ( with a few pockets of simple life ) to one that is crowded with complex life forms .
