@@1353514 Each NASA space shuttle designation is composed of a prefix and suffix separated by a dash . The prefix for operational shuttles is OV , for Orbiter Vehicle . The suffix is composed of two parts : the series and the vehicle number . Series : * 0 - Non-flight ready shuttles * 1 - Flight ready shuttles The vehicle number is sequentially assigned within the series , beginning with 1 . Therefore , there can never be an OV-100 as it would read Orbiter Vehicle Series 1 Vehicle 0 . Many proposals to build a second generation of orbiters , externally compatible with the current system but internally new , refer to them as OV-200 or OV-2xx in order to differentiate them from the current generation , the OV-100s . This terminology is informal , and it is unlikely that any Shuttle-derived vehicle built will be given such designation . # Orbiter Designations # * OV-099 - Space Shuttle ' ' Challenger ' ' , originally STA-099 * OV-101 - Space Shuttle ' ' Enterprise ' ' * OV-102 - Space Shuttle ' ' Columbia ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * OV-104 - Space Shuttle ' ' Atlantis ' ' * OV-105 - Space Shuttle ' ' Endeavour ' ' ' ' Challenger ' ' was originally intended to be used as a Structural Test Article , rather than a flight-capable orbiter ; as such , the numbering was changed when she was rebuilt . ' ' Enterprise ' ' , on the other hand , was intended to be rebuilt into a flight-capable orbiter ; it was found to be cheaper to rebuild STA-099 than OV-101 , so she remained unflown . The designations were not altered , despite these changes in plans . # Other Official Designations # In keeping with this theme , other pieces of ground hardware used by the Space Shuttle program have been given official designations ; these include : * OV-095 - a mockup in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory ( SAIL ) at Johnson Space Center . * STA-096 - Environmental Control and Life Support System Structural Test Article * STA-097 - Vibro Acoustic ( Mid Fuselage ) Structural Test Article * MPTA-098 - the Main Propulsion Test Article ( see below ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of structural components manufactured to replace those used in the construction of ' ' Endeavour ' ' ; however , the contract for these was cancelled shortly afterwards , and they were never completed . The 096 and 097 designators were given to structural test articles that were cancelled , but while they exist in some NASA records , the NASA History Office has no official record of STA-096 and STA-097. # Unofficial and Honorary Designations # One structural mockup has been given an retroactively unofficial and honorary OV-xxx designation : * OV-098 - Space Shuttle ' ' Pathfinder ' ' , a mockup in Huntsville , AL Note that while ' ' Pathfinder ' ' is referred to as OV-098 , she should not be confused with MPTA-098 - the Main Propulsion Test Article , a steel frame ( looking nothing like an Orbiter ) used to test the Space Shuttle Main Engines . ' ' Pathfinder ' ' was originally a fit check unit , a simple mockup resembling the production Orbiters in size , shape and weight , intended to be used to ensure that ground handling facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuilt to resemble them cosmetically , and is currently on display with the external tank used during the propulsion tests ( designated MPTA-ET ) . To further add to the confusion , it appears that Pathfinder was never formally numbered , and the OV-098 designation is both unofficial ' ' and ' ' retroactive . MPTA-098 was later rebuilt into the Shuttle-C mockup during the 1990s ; it is currently in storage at the Stennis Space Center . # Other Unofficial Designations # Finally , one structural mockup was given an unofficial OV-xxx designation in a 2006 version of this article ; while not official , the designation appears to be somewhat accepted . * OV-100 - Space Shuttle ' ' Independence ' ' , formerly ' ' Explorer ' ' a mockup in Houston , TX # References #
