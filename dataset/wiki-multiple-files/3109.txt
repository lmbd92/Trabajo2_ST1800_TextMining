@@27871514 A graduate tax is a proposed method of financing higher education . It has been proposed in the United Kingdom and Ireland . # Background # Under the Higher Education Act 2004 British and European Union students at publicly funded universities in England , Wales and Northern Ireland are charged tuition fees ( called top-up fees ) directly by the universities . The amount of the fees is limited by law and the fees can be funded by government-backed student loans issued by a government-backed company . The loans need only be repaid when the graduate is earning a sufficient amount of money to do so . Non-EU students can be charged an unlimited fee by the universities , and these are usually considerably higher . In 2009 the National Union of Students ( NUS ) proposed a tax on graduates who have received academic degrees over a period of years after the granting of the degree . Four of the five candidates running in the British Labour Party 's leadership election in 2010 also backed the proposal . A graduate tax was mooted before the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected . A system of graduate tax was seriously considered as part of the Browne Review although Vince Cable has stated that No decisions have been made . On 15 July 2010 Vince Cable appeared to endorse a graduate tax , saying in a speech that he was interested in looking at the feasibility of changing the system of financing student tuition so that the repayment mechanism is variable graduate contributions tied to earnings . # NUS proposal # The National Union of Students has proposed a tax that would be levied on graduates for 20 years following their graduation , progressively ranging from 0.3% to 2.5% of their income . # Benefits # A graduate tax would allow education to be free at the point of delivery . Proponents claim that one benefit of a graduate tax is that it would prevent a market in higher education developing whereby students chose where and what to study based upon the ability to pay rather than academic ability . A graduate tax might raise more money for universities over the long term than capped tuition fees , depending on the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate tax admits that an obvious attraction of such a tax is that it is levied only on graduates , the immediate beneficiaries of higher education . Under the NUS 's proposals a ' People 's Trust ' would be set up that would be independent of the Treasury . The current system of loans has been seen as unviable because they require an expensive public subsidy to universities . David Willets has described how a rise in tuition fees would increase public spending : It is in such delicate equilibrium that shifting any single element requires us to shift everything else . If fees were to go up , the government would have to lend people the money to pay for them - and that would push up public spending .... It 's not just that students do n't want to pay higher fees : the Treasury ca n't afford them . So the arrangements we have now are clearly unable to respond to the current economic climate . A graduate tax may not be perceived to be a debt in the same way as a student loan is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that students carry an additional fixed burden of debt into their working lives . Yet , most of us do nt think of our future tax obligations as ' debt ' . The UK Youth Parliament , funded by the British Youth Council , supports the abolition of tuition fees with a view to introducing a graduate tax . In November 2011 at their annual House of Commons debate , former Member of UK Youth Parliament Harrison Carter spoke of the benefits of the tax at the Government Despatch box . He contended that the tax would go straight to universities , bypassing the HM Treasury . He dubbed others naive for not wanting to give something back for an education they would ultimately benefit from . Carter spoke of the country 's duty to educate its citizens . He said we were failing in that duty because the debt from University , for many , makes it an impractical next step . # Criticisms # The graduate tax could create several perverse incentives . For example , graduates of UK universities would have an incentive to move away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or impossible to collect the graduate tax . The Russell group of universities claims that this could deprive the UK of vital skills and knowledge . Further perverse incentives may be present , depending on the details of how the scheme is implemented . If the tax is levied only upon students who graduate , then some students would have an incentive not to graduate after having completed their courses of study . If the tax is levied only upon students who graduate from UK institutions , then some students would have an incentive to transfer from UK universities to foreign institutions for their final year(s) of study . A graduate tax breaks the link between the actual cost of a degree and the amount the graduate pays for it . Some graduates would end up paying more in taxes than their degrees actually cost , while others would pay less . The Russell Group claims that this situation would be unreasonable and likely to be seen by many as unfair . Because individual universities will not derive any direct financial benefit from becoming more attractive to students , the graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive up quality according to the Russell Group . Criticisms include the transitional problems which exist where students are going through university but not paying the tax . Free-market thinkers have criticised the graduate tax for not creating a market based element in higher education . Alistair Jarvis of the 1994 Group of research universities has stated : Any mechanism that prevents variable fees and the functioning of a regulated market would be damaging to the sector ... We strongly support a regulated market because this is the best way to drive up excellence in research and teaching , and to deliver student satisfaction . A system of variable fees has been , and remains , the correct strategy . This system should be developed , rather than fundamentally changed . It has also been argued by ' ' The Independent ' ' that it is too early to change the system again in the United Kingdom . Greenaway argues that a graduate tax would not deliver additional resources rapidly and that there is a potential problem of ' leakage ' with EU nationals leaving the UK and therefore not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell Group Vice-Chancellors as it would likely result in a more equitable distribution of research funding towards less prestigious universities . Nicholas Barr , professor of public economics at the London School of Economics has praised the current system of student loans as a method of financing higher education , arguing that variable fees foster competition that is of benefit to both students and employers . Another problem concerns how foreign students at UK universities and emigrants from Britain would be treated by the tax . Madsen Pirie of the free-market Adam Smith Institute , writing in ' ' The Daily Telegraph ' ' , argues that it is wrong for talented graduates to face higher taxes under a form of progressive taxation and that such a proposal might make emigration more appealing to graduates . A loan can also be paid off early whereas a tax would continue to be charged for a longer period of time . The Universities and Colleges Union , a supporter of free higher education has criticised a graduate tax . Sally Hunt has criticised the tax as a rise in fees by stealth : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach a rise in university fees . If the Government thinks it can get the public to swallow higher fees as some sort of graduate tax , it is living in a dream world . We need a proper debate on how to fund our universities , not an exercise in rebranding . We will judge the plans on what they actually do and whether or not students will be forced to pay more , not how the Government markets them . # Ireland # A graduate tax has also been proposed in Ireland . Since 1995 , the ' ' Free Fees Initiative ' ' has meant that almost all students in the Republic of Ireland from the European Economic Area and Switzerland do not have to pay fees , with the government paying them on their behalf . However , they must pay a ' ' student contribution ' ' ( formally called the ' ' student services charge ' ' and informally known as the ' ' registration charge ' ' ) , which for the academic year 2010/11 was set at a maximum rate of 2,000 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many students from lower-income families can get grants to cover this and other costs ( such as academic field trips ) , as well as a maintenance grant . In March 2009 Fine Gael , then the largest opposition party in Dil ireann , proposed a graduate contribution scheme to replace the current system . In its policy document ' ' The Third Way ' ' it proposed a system that would be automatic and universal ( applying to all graduates regardless of wealth ) , and would amount to 30 per cent of the total cost of their third-level education . The party also proposed to abolish the student contribution so that education would be free at the point of delivery . The contribution would be collected via the PRSI system and would be ring-fenced for third-level education . There would be no interest charged on the contribution and it would not be retrospective . There would be a minimum rate of repayment set by the State , but graduates could increase the amounts repaid if they wished . The scheme appeared in Fine Gael 's 2011 general election manifesto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Labour following the election , they committed to undertake a full review of the Hunt and OECD reports into third-level funding before the end of 2011 . They said that their goal is to introduce a funding system that will provide third-level institutions with reliable funding but does not impact access for students . In December 2011 , in the run-up to Budget 2012 , the Department of Education examined a number of models of funding for third-level education , including a return to fees , a student loan system ( similar to the UK 's or New Zealand 's ) and a graduate tax .
