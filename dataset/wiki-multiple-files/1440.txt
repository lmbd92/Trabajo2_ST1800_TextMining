@@9274514 The Uluguru Mountains are a mountain range in eastern Tanzania , Africa , named after the Luguru tribe . The main portion of the Uluguru Mountains is a ridge running roughly north-south and rising to 2630m ft altitude at its highest point . On the main Uluguru range , 50 villages touch the forest boundary and over 151,000 people are found within the mountain area , often at increasing densities at higher altitudes up to the forest boundary . # Geography # The Ulugurus lie 200 km inland from the Indian Ocean . They are part of a chain of mountains in eastern Africa collectively called the Eastern Arc Mountains , which include the Taita Hills , Pare Mountains , Usambara Mountains , Nguru Mountains , Rubeho , Ukaguru , Udzungwa Mountains and Mahenge Mountains . # Vegetation # The vegetation of the Uluguru main ridge and the outlying blocks is extremely variable . It ranges from drier lowland coastal forest habitats , to transitional rainforests , to sub-montane , montane and upper montane forest types . # Climate # Climatically , the Uluguru mountains capture moisture passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are especially wet , with rainfall estimated at over 3000mm in per annum , with some rain falling in every month . # Water Catchment # The forests of the mountains provide the water catchment areas for the streams and rivers . This water flows mainly from the forest-capped peaks of the Ulugurus with the streams joining to form the Ruvu river , which provides the water supply to the city of Dar es Salaam . Most of the neighboring population , around 3 million people , and the major industries in Tanzania rely on this water supply for their continued survival . The loss of the Uluguru forests and any reduction in water supply potential of the mountains could therefore have a drastic impact on the human well-being and the industrial capacity of Tanzania . # Local people # The local people of the Ulugurus are the Wa ' ' luguru ' ' tribe people . They have been living in the mountains for several hundred years , coming from other areas of Tanzania . The land ownership is through the female line and women are powerful in village life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own the land and make most of the decisions about its use and management . # Biodiversity # In the Ulugurus are home to more than 100 plants , 2 birds , 2 mammals , 4 reptiles and 6 amphibians which are known from nowhere else in the world . In addition to these there are a large number of additional species which are only shared with one or two other Eastern Arc mountains , and hence are globally rare . The endemic species include African Violets , ' ' Impatiens ' ' and Begonias which are popular pot-plants in the rest of the world . # Tourism # The mountains attracts many tourists to the area , particularly due to the mountains ' proximity to the former capital and economic center of Tanzania , the city of Dar es Salaam.
