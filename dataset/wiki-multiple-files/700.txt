@@3014514 occupation = Historian , political activist Ilan Papp ( ; born 1954 ) is an Israeli historian and socialist activist . He is a professor with the College of Social Sciences and International Studies at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom , director of the university 's European Centre for Palestine Studies , and co-director of the Exeter Centre for Ethno-Political Studies . Papp was born in Haifa , Israel . Prior to coming to the UK , he was a senior lecturer in political science at the University of Haifa ( 19842007 ) and chair of the Emil Touma Institute for Palestinian and Israeli Studies in Haifa ( 20002008 ) . He is the author of ' ' The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine ' ' ( 2006 ) , ' ' The Modern Middle East ' ' ( 2005 ) , ' ' A History of Modern Palestine : One Land , Two Peoples ' ' ( 2003 ) , and ' ' Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict ' ' ( 1988 ) . He was also a leading member of Hadash , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 Knesset elections . Papp is one of Israel 's New Historians who , since the release of pertinent British and Israeli government documents in the early 1980s , have been rewriting the history of Israel 's creation in 1948 , and the corresponding expulsion or flight of 700,000 Palestinians in the same year . He has written that the expulsions were not decided on an ' ' ad hoc ' ' basis , as other historians have argued , but constituted the ethnic cleansing of Palestine , in accordance with Plan Dalet , drawn up in 1947 by Israel 's future leaders . He blames the creation of Israel for the lack of peace in the Middle East , arguing that Zionism is more dangerous than Islamic militancy , and has called for an international boycott of Israeli academics . Papp supports the one-state solution , which envisages a binational state for Palestinians and Israelis . . His work has been both supported and criticized by other historians . Before he left Israel in 2008 , he had been condemned in the Knesset , Israel 's parliament ; a minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his photograph had appeared in a newspaper at the centre of a target ; and he had received several death threats . # Early life and education # Papp was born in Haifa to German-Jewish parents who fled Nazi persecution in the 1930s . At the age of 18 , he was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces , serving in the Golan Heights during the 1973 Yom Kippur War . He graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1978 , and in 1984 obtained his PhD in history from the University of Oxford , under the guidance of Arab historian Albert Hourani and Roger Owen . His doctoral thesis became his first book , ' ' Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict ' ' . # Academic career # Papp was the Academic Director of the Research Institute for Peace at Givat Haviva from 1993 to 2000 , and chair of the Emil Touma Institute for Palestinian Studies . Papp left the University of Haifa in 2007 , to take up his appointment in Exeter , after his endorsement of the boycott of Israeli universities led the president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found it increasingly difficult to live in Israel with his unwelcome views and convictions . In a Qatari newspaper interview explaining his decision , he said : I was boycotted in my university and there had been attempts to expel me from my job . I am getting threatening calls from people every day . I am not being viewed as a threat to the Israeli society but my people think that I am either insane or my views are irrelevant . Many Israelis also believe that I am working as a mercenary for the Arabs . # Katz controversy # Papp publicly supported an M.A. thesis by Haifa University student Teddy Katz , which was approved with highest honors , that claimed Israel had committed a massacre in the Palestinian village of Al-Tantura during the war in 1948 , based upon interviews with Arab residents of the village and with an Israeli veteran of the operation . Neither Israeli nor Palestinian historians had previously recorded any such incident , which Meyrav Wurmser described as a made-up massacre , but , according to Papp , the story of Tantura had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . It appears in the memoirs of a Haifa notable , Muhammad Nimr al-Khatib , who , a few days after the battle , recorded the testimony of a Palestinian . In December 2000 , Katz was sued for libel by veterans of the Alexandroni Brigade and after the testimony was heard , he retracted his allegations about the massacre . Twelve hours later , he retracted his retraction . During the trial , lawyers for the veterans pointed to what they said were discrepancies between the taped interviews Katz conducted and descriptions in Katz 's thesis . Katz revised his thesis , and , following the trial , the university appointed a committee to examine it . The assessment of the revised thesis was highly mixed , but overall it was failed . Papp continues to defend both Katz and his thesis . Tom Segev and others argued that there is merit or some truth in what Katz described . According to the Israeli new historian Benny Morris : There is no unequivocal proof of a large-scale massacre at Tantura , but war crimes were perpetrated there . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knesset elections as seventh on the Communist Party-led Hadash list . After years of political activism , Papp supports economic and political boycotts of Israel , including an academic boycott . He believes boycotts are justified because the Israeli occupation is a dynamic process and it becomes worse with each passing day . The AUT can choose to stand by and do nothing , or to be part of a historical movement similar to the anti-apartheid campaign against the white supremacist regime in South Africa . By choosing the latter , it can move us forward along the only remaining viable and non-violent road to saving both Palestinians and Israelis from an impending catastrophe . As a result , University of Haifa President Aharon Ben-Ze'ev called on Papp to resign , saying : it is fitting for someone who calls for a boycott of his university to apply the boycott himself . He said that Papp would not be ostracized , since that would undermine academic freedom , but he should leave voluntarily . In the same year , Papp initiated the annual Israeli Right of return conferences , which called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were expelled in 1948. # Critical assessment # Ilan Papp 's books have been praised by Walid Khalidi , Richard Falk , Ella Shohat , Nur Masalha and John Pilger among others . Those critical of his work include Benny Morris , Efraim Karsh , Herbert London and Steven Plaut , as well as Professors Daniel Gutwein and Yossi Ben-Artzi from Haifa University . Papp has replied to this criticism . In 2012 , the ' ' Journal of Palestine Studies ' ' ( ' ' JPS ' ' ) translated and published a 1937 letter of David Ben-Gurion after the pro-Israel media monitoring group CAMERA reported an error in an article that Papp wrote for the JPS after CAMERA informed them that a quote in the article had been incorrectly attributed to . Nonetheless , the JPS stated that the translated letter confirmed that , regardless of Papp 's citation errors , the underlying interpretation of the letter provided by Papp 's article and book was sound . CAMERA countered by providing by Ben-Gurion , and charged not only that the pertinent phrase had been incorrectly translated , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . # Published work # # Books # * * The Boycott Will Work : An Israeli Perspective in Audrea Lim ( ed. ) * * ( with Noam Chomsky ) ' ' Gaza in Crisis : Reflections on Israel 's War Against the Palestinians ' ' ( Hamish Hamilton , 2010 ) .
