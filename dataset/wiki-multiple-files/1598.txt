' The Road Goes On ' is loosely based on Bilbo 's walking song spoken by Bilbo and Frodo in ' ' The Hobbit ' ' and ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' respectively . ' The Cat and the Moon ' takes some of its lyrics from Frodo 's drinking song in ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' . ' The Song of Hope ' includes Elvish lyrics , which are a reworking of Galadriel 's lament ( in ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' ) , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lament for Moria ' takes lyrics from Gimli 's lament in ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' . The song ' Lothlrien ' is performed by Legolas as an introduction to Galadriel . At the same point in the novel Legolas sings about the Elf-maiden Nimrodel , and although the two songs share a similar sentiment their lyrics are unrelated . The song ' Now And For Always ' is taken from a conversation between Frodo and Sam in ' ' The Two Towers ' ' . The lyrics to ' Wonder ' , performed by Galadriel , are reminiscent of the Song of Eldamara lament sung and played on the harp by Galadriel in ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' . Many of the songs feature lyrics in Quenya , one of the fictional languages developed by Tolkien , despite the fact that the Elves during the Third Age communicated in Sindarin . The writers opted for Quenya because Tolkien had developed this language the most and it is a form of Elvish appropriate to the characters . # Original London Cast Recording # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2008 , and features 18 musical numbers from the show .
