He has served in the National Assembly of Quebec since 2003 , representing Orford as a member of the Quebec Liberal Party . Reid is a former cabinet minister in Jean Charest 's government . He is not to be confused with a senior public servant in Quebec named Pierre Reid . # Early life and academic career # Reid was born in Jonquire , Quebec . He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Universit Laval ( 1970 ) and a Ph.D . in mathematics from Universit de Paris XI ( 1974 ) . After working as a computer consultant for IBM Canada , Reid became a professor of administrative data processing at the Universit du Qubec Chicoutimi in 1976 . Two years later , he joined the business administration department at the Universit de Sherbrooke . He became a vice-rector of the university in 1989 , and four years later he defeated Marie Malavoy to become university rector . Reid supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which provided a $105,000 scholarship for research in the natural gas sector . He speculated about privatizing some academic programs in 1996 , to find new revenue sources in light of government cutbacks . In 2001 , he welcomed a $4.7 million investment from the government of Canada to fund health researchers on campus . Reid was appointed as an associate deputy minister at Industry Canada in 2001. # Legislator # # Education minister # Reid was a star candidate for the Liberal Party in the 2003 provincial election and was easily elected as the Member of the National Assembly of Quebec for Orford . The Liberal Party won a majority government in this election under Jean Charest 's leadership , and Charest appointed Reid as his education minister on April 29 , 2003 . A ' ' Montreal Gazette ' ' report from this period indicated that Reid was well regarded for his skills as a manager and administrator . ; University funding Reid made significant changes to university student funding in 2004 , shifting $103 million from bursaries to repayable loans . He also announced that student loans would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to income after graduation ; in some cases , graduates would not be required to make payments during periods of unemployment . Student leaders and the opposition Parti Qubcois strongly criticized the shift from bursaries to loans , describing it as a betrayal of the province 's lower-income students . The Canadian Federation of Students also criticized Reid 's repayment policy , with one student leader sarcastically describing it as Study now , pay forever . Reid argued in response that his changes would allow more students to register at universities . There were several protests against Reid 's funding reforms in 2004 and 2005 , including one protest in February 2005 that turned violent . Reid promised to re-invest massive funding into loans and bursaries after a revolt of the Liberal Party 's youth wing in late 2004 , but did not remain in the education portfolio long enough to carry this out . Reid promised in November 2004 that he would maintain Quebec 's long-standing university tuition freeze during the Charest government 's first mandate , but would not make any commitments beyond that time . ; Jewish private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association between Quebec 's public schools and Jewish private schools in a bid to improve cultural ties . This decision was made after the firebombing of one of Montreal 's United Talmud Torah schools which resulted in the destruction of a library . The following month , Quebec media sources discovered that the Charest government had agreed to pay full funding to Jewish private schools through the cultural association . This was a shift from a previous policy of funding about sixty per cent of the costs . The funding decision was made without cabinet approval or discussion ; when it became public knowledge , Reid indicated that other private religious and cultural schools would also be eligible for such funding . Several public school officials , teachers groups , and parents groups criticized the decision on the grounds that it would undermine public education . The Charest government was ultimately forced to cancel its plans following an extremely negative public reaction . While still supporting the funding change in principle , Charest acknowledged that his government had handled the matter poorly . One ' ' Montreal Gazette ' ' columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing its funding policy change from the beginning . The controversy damaged Reid 's public standing . ; High schools In May 2003 , Reid announced that francophone schools would start English lessons in the first grade and devote more class time to English-language education . The previous Parti Qubcois government had brought English lessons forward from the fourth to the third grade , but had reduced the overall time devoted to English . Reid announced in 2004 that persons with serious criminal records would not receive provincial teaching certificates . He dropped plans to introduce a professional teaching order after teachers voted in large numbers against the plan . ; Federal initiatives In addition to serving as provincial education minister , Reid was also appointed to a two-year term as chair of the Council of Ministers of Education , Canada in October 2003 . Reid was critical of the Canadian Council on Learning introduced by Jean Chrtien 's federal government , saying that its money would be better spent on provincial initiatives . # Government services minister and backbencher # Widely regarded as having mishandled the university funding and Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister after a cabinet shuffle on February 18 , 2005 . An editorial in the ' ' Montreal Gazette ' ' later described this as a make-work position for Reid . This position offered him a much lower public profile , and he was dropped from cabinet entirely on February 27 , 2006 . During his time as government services minister , Reid announced that the Charest government would replace an information management system approved by the previous ministry . Reid supported the Charest government 's plan to sell part of the Mont-Orford National Park to private interests in 2006 , despite the concerns of environmental groups and some Liberal backbenchers . Critics noted that Reid was the friend of a key developer who stood to benefit from the sale , although Reid responded that his friend was only one of many potential buyers . Reid was narrowly re-elected in the 2007 provincial election , which reduced the Liberals to a minority government . He was returned to a third term in the 2008 election , as the Liberals regained majority status . He has not been returned to cabinet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced funding for a new arena in honour of hockey coach Pat Burns , who was suffering from and later died of terminal cancer .
