@@1337514 Mabel is an English female given name derived from the Latin ' ' amabilis ' ' , lovable , dear . Amabilis of Riom ( d. 475 ) was a French male saint who logically would have assumed the name Amabilis upon entering the priesthood : his veneration may have resulted in Amabilis being used as both a male and female name or the name 's female usage may have been initiated by the female saint Amabilis of Rouen ( d. 634 ) , the daughter of an Anglo-Saxon king who would have adopted the name Amabilis upon becoming a nun .
