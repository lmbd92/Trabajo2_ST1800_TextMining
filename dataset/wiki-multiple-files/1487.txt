@@9902514 ' ' Por Estas Calles ' ' ( English : ' ' On These Streets ' ' ) is a telenovela broadcast by Radio Caracas Televisin between 1992 and 1994 . It was extremely popular in Venezuela , due to its very realistic approach to the day-to-day life of the country and local tone . It was the first Venezuelan program to give a realistic view of the corruption in political life , as well as the first to show the day-to-day life in the poor ' ' barrios ' ' . For example , it showed the impact on poor people 's lives of the intermittent water supply , showing community meetings and lovers ' trysts cut short by the news that the water was on , sending everyone running to fill storage tanks and barrels . It was considered by the Spanish language # History # In early 1992 Venezuela was in a very unstable political situation . At the same time , RCTV was in a low-rating stage . The network decided to take the risk of making a story which took place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Por Estas Calles began as a traditional telenovela called Eva Marina . During the pre-production stage , however , the concept changed from a traditional romance to a more actual , street-related story . The original chapters were wiped and the history , now under its new name and concept , began its filming . The telenovela was initially written by Ibsen Martnez , but he resigned six months later . It is believed that RCTV demanded him not only an extension ( something very usual when a telenovela is very successful ) but also a better ending for characters who were very popular but morally questionable , something he was not willing to do . Despite his absence , the telenovela lasted for another year under a team of scriptwriters , and when it ended it was still popular . Por Estas Calles inspired a rival telenovela with similar themes , El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios , produced by Marte TV and broadcast by RCTV rival channel Venevisin . But this telenovela was quickly recognized as a bad ripoff , was comparably tame and lasted much less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Por Estas Calles ' ' . At the beginning , the main story revolved around the tribulations of elementary teacher Eurdice Briceo , falsely accused of murder , who has to hide under a new identity . But the other characters soon took bigger screen time , and it became an ensemble story . During its runtime , ' ' Por Estas Calles ' ' adapted many stories inspired by news headlines . One of the show 's characters , Don Chepe Orellana , bore a striking resemblance to former president Jaime Lusinchi , who in real life had of course been manipulated by Blanca Ibez . On the show , Don Chepe and his mistress Lucha pocketed public money with one sleight-of-hand move after another , doled out favors to campaign contributors , developed all kinds of illegal schemes to hold on to power , and ruthlessly eliminated political enemies . # Characters # The cast was one of the greatest and most memorable in the entire history of Venezuelan telenovelas .

Some of the most popular characters were : * Eurdice Briceo ' ' ( Maralejandra Martn ) ' ' : the main character . A barrio-raised school teacher who is falsely blamed for the killing of a man . She hides by taking the false identity of Eva Marina . During the soap opera , she was romantically involved with a judge named lvaro Infante ( interpreted by Aroldo Betancourt ) and , later , with the drug lord Sarra Vlez . Although she was the protagonist , she was somewhat overshadowed by the other characters . * Eudomar Santos ' ' ( Franklin Virgez ) ' ' : an archetypical barrio man , who cared only about the present day and had no ambition or working disposition . Eudomar is a very opportunistic man , who knows his attractiveness and uses it as his advantage . His catchphrases que es lo que est pa'sopa and Como vaya viniendo vamos viendo became very popular , and very descriptive of Venezuelan idiosyncrasy .

He is basically evil , but in a mischievous and almost playful way , which made him difficult to hate . His main gimmick was that while he says one thing , his real thoughts were heard by the watcher . * Don Chepe Orellana ' ' ( Hector Myerston ) ' ' : a rich businessman with political ambitions , and a penchant for breaking the law . * Natalio Vega el hombre de la etiqueta ' ' ( Carlos Villamizar ) ' ' : an ex-policeman whose son was killed very early in the story .

One of the most notable controversies was related to a boy actor who played a street kid and who became a precocious criminal . The success of Por Estas Calles allegedly drove many independent producers into financial ruin , including the then powerful rival Marte TV , which attempted to produce a rival telenovela with similar themes titled ' ' El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios ' ' . Unlike Por Estas Calles , El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios was not a success , and lasted only a few months . # Trivia # * The theme song , Por estas calles , sung by Venezuelan singer Yordano , became a big hit and topped the charts for a year . * It was the first Telenovela that contained difficult themes such as corruption , drug trafficking , and children on the streets . * While promoting the telenovela prior to its debut , one of the stunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Don Chepe .

During an episode , the characters were transported to the Por Estas Ealles era and met the characters they played then .
