@@2340514 -- The Zarubintsy or Zarubinets culture was a culture that from the 3rd century BC until 1st century AD flourished in the area north of the Black Sea along the upper and middle Dnieper and Pripyat Rivers , stretching west towards the Southern Bug river . Zarubintsy sites were particularly dense between the Rivers Desna and Ros as well as along the Pripyat river . It was identified around 1899 by the Czech-Ukrainian archaeologist V. V. Chvojka and is now attested by about 500 sites . The culture was named after finds cremated remains in the village of Zarubintsy , on the Dnieper . The Zarubintsy culture was influenced by the La Tne culture and the nomads of the steppes ( the Scythians and the Sarmatians ) . The Scythian and Sarmatian influence is evident , especially in pottery , weaponry and domestic and personal objects . From the 3rd century and onwards , the culture was connected by the Goths and became part of the Chernyakhov culture . # Settlements # The bearers of the culture engaged in agriculture , documented by numerous finds of sickles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ' slash-and-burn ' ) to plough-type cultivation . In addition , they raised animals . Remains included sheep , goat , cattle , horses and swine . There is evidence they also traded wild animal skins with Black Sea towns . Some sites were defended by ditches and banks , structures thought to have been built to defend against nomadic tribes from the steppe . Dwellings were either of surface or semi-subterranean types , with posts supporting the walls , a hearth in the middle , and large conic pits located nearby . # Burials # Inhabitants practiced cremation . Cremated remains were either placed in large , hand-made ceramic urns , or were placed in a large pit and surrounded by food and ornaments such as spiral bracelets and Middle to Late La-Tene type ' ' fibulae ' ' . # Decline # The disintegration of the Zarubintsy culture has been linked with the emigration of its population in several directions .

The movement of Zarubintsy groups has been linked to an increasingly arid climate , whereby the population left the hillforts on high promontories and moved southward into river valleys . This mostly southern movement brought them closer to westward moving Sarmatian groups ( from the Don region ) and Thracian-Celtic elements . By the 3rd century AD , central late Zarubintsy sites ' re-arranged ' into the so-called Kiev culture , whilst the westernmost areas were integrated into the Wielbark culture .
