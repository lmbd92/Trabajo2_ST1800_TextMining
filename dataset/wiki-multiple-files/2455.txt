@@20853514 The YunnanBurma Railway ( alternatively : Burma-Yunnan Railway ) was a failed British project to connect far south-west China 's Yunnan province with the recently established rail network in British-ruled Burma . # History and Politics # The British project was working against the background of the successful French Yunnan-Vietnam Railway that had been established on the nearby Hanoi to Kunming route from 19041910 , some 30 years earlier . To secure the rights to construction , Britain referred to Article IV of the Anglo-French Siam Convention for ' mutual privileges ' . # Planning and surveying # Maria Bugrova 's article discusses the question of a railway to Yunnan from Burma . : ' ' In the 1880s , Great Britain drew special attention to the Upper Burma region and the roads to southwestern China . The former colonial officer of British Burma 's administration , A.R . Colquhoun , and an engineer of the Civil Works Department in India , H. Hallett , traveled in 1882 from Canton to Rangoon . A.R Colquhoun returned to England and sent his proposal to the Chamber of Commerce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Rangoon and southwestern China through the Shan states . His proposal was approved by the Chamber . According to a preliminary calculation , the cost of work was about seven thousand pound sterling . One half of this amount had to be presented by the Chambers of Commerce , and another part had to be contributed by the Government . ' ' : ' ' By the end of 1884 , Hallett and Colquhoun received 3,500 pounds from the Chamber of Commerce for the investigation of building a railway . They found important information about climate , population and minerals . They drew special attention to liking . From their point of view , penetration of British goods into China depended on the amount of this tax . The difficulty of liking question substantially explained the British traders ' interest in building a railway . In case of this building it would be possible to avoid the payment of liking transferring goods to the interior of China . Colquhoun telegraphed daily to The Times about the expedition . ' ' There are references in the 1898 British ' ' Hansard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Little 's 1905 book ' ' The Far East ' ' mentioned the proposed route on page 124 : An article by Royal Arch Gunnison published in the ' ' San Francisco Chronicle ' ' on Thursday , November 27 , 1941 stated that American Engineers still expected 12 to 15 months to complete the railway and described a Dr. Victor Haas of the United States Public Health Service as in charge of sanitation and malaria prevention . Additional American personnel such as Paul Stevenson accepted commissions with the United States Public Health Service and were sent to assist with malaria control during the construction effort . # Abandonment # Unfortunately , it seems that construction of the line was abandoned due to Japanese advances , and was never resumed . Burma 's limited trading value to China and its internal political and military instability have probably been two major contributing factors . # Legacy # Today the Yunnan side of the line lies in ruin . Though signs here and there attest to its presence , there is little actual rail left , and the line has all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the most determined travellers . One such sign can be glimpsed opposite the ferry to Baodian , slightly south of Manwan in the far north-eastern section of Lincang prefecture . The sign records a tunnel from the construction , but the entry has long been covered over and there is no visual hint to the line 's presence whatsoever .
