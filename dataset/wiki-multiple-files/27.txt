@@53514 Edith Louisa Cavell ( ; 4 December 1865 12 October 1915 ) was a British nurse . She is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers from both sides without distinction and in helping some 200 Allied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium during the First World War , for which she was arrested . She was subsequently court-martialled , found guilty of treason and sentenced to death . Despite international pressure for mercy , she was shot by a German firing squad . Her execution received worldwide condemnation and extensive press coverage . She is well known for her statement that patriotism is not enough . Her strong Anglican beliefs propelled her to help all those who needed it , both German and Allied soldiers . She was quoted as saying , I cant stop while there are lives to be saved . 12 October is appointed for her commemoration in the Anglican church , although this is not a saint 's feast day in the traditional sense . Edith Cavell , who was 49 at the time of her execution , was already notable as a pioneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career # Edith Cavell was born on 4 December 1865 in Swardeston , a village near Norwich , where her father was vicar for 45 years . She was the eldest of the four children of the Reverend Frederick and Louisa Sophia Cavell and was taught always to share with the less fortunate , despite her familys meagre income . After a period as a governess , including for a family in Brussels 18901895 , she trained as a nurse at the London Hospital under Matron Eva Luckes and worked in various hospitals in England , including Shoreditch Infirmary . In 1907 , Cavell was recruited by Dr Antoine Depage to be matron of a newly established nursing school , L ' cole Belge dInfirmires Diplmes , ( or The Berkendael Medical Institute ) on the Rue de la Culture ( now Rue Franz Merjay ) , Ixelles in Brussels . By 1910 , Miss Cavell felt that the profession of nursing had gained sufficient foothold in Belgium to warrant the publishing of a professional journal , and therefore launched the nursing journal , ' ' L'infirmire ' ' .

She returned to Brussels , where her clinic and nursing school were taken over by the Red Cross . # First World War and execution # In November 1914 , after the German occupation of Brussels , Cavell began sheltering British soldiers and funnelling them out of occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands . Wounded British and French soldiers and Belgian and French civilians of military age were hidden from the Germans and provided with false papers by Prince Reginald de Croy at his chteau of Bellignies near Mons. From there , they were conducted by various guides to the houses of Cavell , Louis Sverin and others in Brussels , and furnished by them with money to reach the Dutch frontier and with guides obtained through Philippe Baucq . She was arrested on 3 August 1915 and charged with harbouring Allied soldiers . She had been betrayed by Gaston Quien , who was later convicted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prosecuted for aiding British and French soldiers , in addition to young Belgian men , to cross the border and eventually enter Britain . She admitted her guilt when she signed a statement the day before the trial . Cavell declared that the soldiers she had helped escape thanked her in writing when arriving safely in Britain . This admission confirmed that Cavell had helped the soldiers navigate the Dutch frontier , but it also established that she helped them escape to a country at war with Germany . The penalty according to German military law was death . Paragraph 58 of the German Military Code said ; Will be sentenced to death for treason any person who , with the intention of helping the hostile Power , or of causing harm to the German or allied troops , is guilty of one of the crimes of paragraph 90 of the German Penal Code . The case referred to in the above-mentioned paragraph 90 consists of Conducting soldiers to the enemy . Additionally , the penalties according to paragraph 160 of the German Code , in case of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Geneva Convention ordinarily guaranteed protection of medical personnel , that protection was forfeit if used as cover for any belligerent action . This forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the Convention , which was the version in force at the time . The German authorities instead justified prosecution merely on the basis of the German law and the interests of the German state . The British government could do nothing to help her . Sir Horace Rowland of the Foreign Office said , I am afraid that it is likely to go hard with Miss Cavell ; I am afraid we are powerless . Lord Robert Cecil , Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs , said , Any representation by us , he advised , will do her more harm than good . The United States , however , had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure . Hugh S. Gibson , First Secretary of the U.S. legation at Brussels , made clear to the German government that executing Cavell would further harm Germany 's already damaged reputation . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von der Lancken of the burning of Leuven Baron von der Lancken is known to have stated that Cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives , German as well as Allied . However , Traugott von Sauberzweig Cavell was not arrested for espionage , as many were led to believe , but for treason . When in custody , Cavell was questioned in French , but the session was minuted in German . This gave the interrogator the opportunity to misinterpret her answers . Although she may have been misrepresented , she made no attempt to defend herself . Cavell was provided with a defender approved by the German military governor . A previous defender , who was chosen for Cavell by her assistant , Elizabeth Wilkins , The night before her execution , she told the Reverend Stirling Gahan , the Anglican chaplain who had been allowed to see her and to give her Holy Communion , Patriotism is not enough . I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone . From his sick bed Brand Whitlock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Cavell 's behalf to Moritz von Bissing , the governor general of Belgium . Hugh Gibson ; Maitre G. de Leval , the legal adviser to the United States legation ; and Rodrigo Saavedra y Vinent , 2nd Marques de Villalobar , the Spanish minister , formed a midnight deputation of appeal for mercy or at least postponement of sentence . There is also a dispute over the sentencing imposed under the German Military Code . Supposedly , the death penalty relevant to the offence committed by Cavell was not officially declared until a few hours after her death . On instructions from the Spanish minister , Belgian women immediately buried her body next to Saint-Gilles Prison . # Role in First World War propaganda # In the months and years following Cavell 's death , countless newspaper articles , pamphlets , images , and books publicised her story . She became an iconic propaganda figure for military recruitment in Britain , and to help increase favourable sentiment towards the Allies in the United States . She was a popular icon because of her sex , her nursing profession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was represented as an act of German barbarism and moral depravity . News reports shortly following Cavell 's execution were found to be only true in part . Even the ' ' American Journal of Nursing ' ' repeated the fictional account of Cavell 's execution in which she fainted and fell because of her refusal to wear a blindfold in front of the firing squad . Allegedly , while she lay unconscious , the German commanding officer shot her dead with a revolver . Numerous accounts like these stimulated international outrage and general anti-German sentiments . Along with the invasion of Belgium , and the sinking of the ' ' RMS Lusitania Because of the British government 's decision to use Cavell 's story as propaganda , she became the most prominent British female casualty of First World War . The combination of heroic appeal and a resonant atrocity-story narrative made Cavell 's case one of the most effective in British propaganda of the First World War , as well as a factor in enduring post-war anti-German sentiment . Before the First World War , Cavell was not well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different depictions of her in British propaganda , which ignored anything that did not fit this image , including the suggestion that Cavell , during her interrogation , had given information that incriminated others . In November 1915 , the British Foreign Office issued a denial that Cavell had implicated anyone else in her testimony . One image commonly represented was of Cavell as an innocent victim of a ruthless and dishonourable enemy . This view depicted her as innocent of espionage , and was most commonly used in various forms of British propaganda , such as postcards and newspaper illustrations during the war . Her story was presented in the British press as a means of fuelling a desire for revenge on the battlefield . These images implied that men must enlist in the armed forces immediately in order to stop the murder of innocent British women . Another , second , representation of Cavell during the First World War saw her described as a serious , reserved , brave , and patriotic woman who devoted her life to nursing and died to save others . This portrayal has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Red Cross nurse . Pastor Le Seur , the German army chaplain , recalled at the time of her execution , I do not believe that Miss Cavell wanted to be a martyrbut she was ready to die for her country Miss Cavell was a very brave woman and a faithful Christian . # German response # Unlike the rest of the world , the German government thought that they had acted fairly towards Cavell . In a letter , German undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Dr Alfred Zimmermann ( not to be confused with Arthur Zimmerman , German Secretary for Foreign Affairs ) made a statement to the press on behalf of the German government : From the Germans ' perspective , had they released Cavell , there would have been a surge in the number of women participating in acts against Germany because they knew they would not be severely punished . It was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to Germany and ignore the worlds condemnation . Their laws do not make distinctions between sexes , the only exception to this rule being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( probably this means pregnant ) condition could not be executed . The German government also believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts . The court paid particular attention to this point , releasing several accused persons because there was doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable. # Burial and memorials # Cavell 's remains were returned to Britain after the war and a state funeral was held at Westminster Abbey . On 19 May 1919 , her body was reburied at the east side of Norwich Cathedral ; a graveside service is still held each October . The railway van that conveyed her remains from Dover to London is kept as a memorial on the Kent and East Sussex Railway and is usually open to view at Bodiam railway station . Following Cavell 's death , many memorials were created around the world to remember her . One of the first was the one unveiled 12 October 1918 by Alexandra of Denmark In the Calendar of saints ( Church of England ) the day appointed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a memorial in her honour rather than formal canonisation .
