Descended from an old Breton family , he entered the army in late 1806 as a Second Lieutenant , serving as an aide-de-camp to Marshal Lannes and then Prince Eugene . Comte de la Bdoyre saw active service in Spain , Italy , Germany , Russia and France , and was awarded the Legion of Honour and the Iron Crown . He was a Colonel commanding the 7th Regiment of the Line at Grenoble when Napoleon returned from exile in Elba and marched north to Paris .

As a result of these orders and counter-orders , d'Erlon 's 20,000 men , which could have sealed the fate of the Anglo-Dutch at Quatre-Bras or the Prussians at Ligny , spent the entire day marching back and forth without firing a shot . Two days later at the Battle of Waterloo , de la Bdoyre was one of the last to leave the battlefield . Afterward , finding that he was not eligible for amnesty as he believed , he secretly travelled to Paris in order to see his wife before heading to Switzerland and exile , but was recognized and arrested . La Bdoyre was tried by a military court and condemned to death by firing squad , and this was confirmed and carried out at the plain of Grenelle on 19 August 1815 . At his death he was aged only 29 .
