Helen A , unable to escape , only comes to understand the Doctor 's notion that happiness can only truly be appreciated when counter-balanced with sadness when she discovers Fifi 's remains . Helen A was intended to be a caricature of then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . In 2010 , Sylvester McCoy told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Margaret Thatcher was far more terrifying than any monster the Doctor had encountered . The Doctor 's calls on the drones to down their tools and revolt was intended as a reference to the 198485 miners ' strike . # Abzorbaloff # The Abzorbaloff is a monster designed by nine-year-old William Grantham of Colchester , Essex for a Design a ' ' Doctor Who ' ' Monster competition held by ' ' Blue Peter ' ' . The competition was announced in July 2005 , and received 43,920 entries . These were judged by Blue Peter editor Richard Marson , presenter Gethin Jones , ' ' Doctor Who ' ' producer Russell T Davies and Tenth Doctor David Tennant . The first prize for the competition was to have the monster appear in an episode of ' ' Doctor Who ' ' . Tennant announced the winner on ' ' Blue Peter ' ' on 17 August 2005 . Conditions of the competition meant that the monster had to be able to be made from prosthetics and not require CGI . Russell T Davies revealed on the ' ' Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grantham imagined the Abzorbaloff to be the size of a double-decker bus , so was initially disappointed to see the final size of his creation . However , Grantham 's design had not included size specifications ( though the remains of the monster 's victims on and within his body hinted at his being huge ) and a larger size would not have fit the criteria of the competition unless the monster were superimposed on footage later on a larger scale . Ultimately , CGI was used for some shots of the talking faces on the Abzorbaloff . Appearing in the episode Love &amp; Monsters , the Abzorbaloff , played by Peter Kay , is a creature that absorbs other living beings into his body with a simple touch . In doing so , the Abzorbaloff makes his victims part of himself , adding their memories and knowledge to his own . The victims retain their identity and consciousness for at least several weeks after absorption , during which time their faces can be seen embedded in his flesh , but eventually , those too are eliminated as they are fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process works both ways in becoming part of the Abzorbaloff , they are able to access his thoughts , just as he is able to access theirs . To restrain his absorption ability , the Abzorbaloff requires the use of a limitation field , which limits absorption to physical contact . The Abzorbaloff hails from Clom , the sister planet to Raxacoricofallapatorius , homeworld of the criminal Slitheen clan . Despite a passing resemblance to them , the Abzorbaloff speaks of the Raxacoricofallapatorians with contempt . Seeking to absorb the Doctor and his hundreds of years of experience , the Abzorbaloff adopts a human disguise as Victor Kennedy , his limitation field generated by the ornate cane he wields . Taking charge of LINDA ( London Investigation ' N ' Detective Agency ) , a small group of ordinary people who followed the exploits of the Doctor , the Abzorbaloff steadily absorbs their numbers one by one , until only Elton Pope remains . Pursuing Pope through the back streets of London , the Abzorbaloff is confronted by the Doctor , who stirs the absorbed victims to fight against the monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victims make him drop his cane , which Elton snaps in two , destroying the limitation field and causing the Abzorbaloff 's absorption power to run out of control . His body collapses into liquid and is itself absorbed by the Earth . Abzorbaloff is not the actual name of the species , but was coined independently by Elton Pope and the Doctor . The monster is seen to approve of the term , however . Other names thrown at him by the Doctor and Elton include Abzorbatron , Abzorbaling , Abzorbatrix and Abzorbaclon . The ' ' Doctor Who ' ' website refers to Slitheen distant cousins by the name of Absorvalovian Rebels in one of Captain Jack 's Monster Files . # Father Angelo # Father Angelo is the leader of the monks who capture the Torchwood Estate and give refuge to a werewolf , as seen in Tooth and Claw ( 2006 ) .

At the end of the story , the Animus 's true form is revealed , as resembling an octopus with some arachnid features . The First Doctor , Ian , Barbara and Vicki help the Menoptra to destroy the Animus using the Menoptra 's secret weapon , the Isop-tope . The Animus returns or is mentioned in several spin-off stories . In the Missing Adventure ' ' Twilight of the Gods ' ' by Christopher Bulis , the Second Doctor , Jamie and Victoria return to Vortis and encounter a seed of the Animus which had survived . The New Adventure ' ' All-Consuming Fire ' ' by Andy Lane identifies the Animus with the Great Old One Lloigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Russell T Davies in the ' ' Doctor Who Annual 2006 ' ' says that the Greater Animus perished in the Time War , and its Carsenome ' ' ( sic ) ' ' Walls fell into dust . In 2013 comic book series Prisoners of Time the Doctor , Vicki , Ian and Barbara encounter the Animus on Earth , which it has travelled to with help from a mysterious figure who kidnaps the Doctor 's companions . # Azal # Azal is the Dmon from the planet Dmos that terrorises Devil 's End in the Third Doctor story ' ' The Dmons ' ' .

With the aid of Caw , a robotic parrot , Balthazar puts a tracking device on the Doctor so the Doctor and Martha would find ' ' The Infinite ' ' a huge spaceship that can grant people their heart 's desire for him . Once he finds ' ' The Infinite ' ' Baltazar discovers an illusion showing what the heart desires . After the Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to tear the ship apart , he orders Squawk to escort him backto Volag-Noc .

This counterweight extends out in a funnel into open space . The Beast is imprisoned by Disciples of Light , who have crafted its prison such that if it ever frees itself , the gravitational force will collapse and the planet , and the Beast with it , will be pulled into the black hole . The Beast is awakened when a human expedition party fly their ship through the funnel to land on the planet , hoping to excavate and claim the power source for their Empire . The Beast telepathically speaks through the empathic Ood , who becomes the Legion of the Beast , and later possesses Toby Zed . Resembling a huge horned demon , the Beast claims that it is the basis of the Devil figure in all religions and mythologies ( including Abaddon , Satan , the Kaled god of war , and Lucifer ) , and that it originates from before the creation of the universe . It is uncertain whether this is true and the exact nature of the Beast remains uncertain . The Beast knows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom it speaks , and the Doctor describes it as extremely intelligent . Intending to escape Krop Tor , the Beast possesses Toby Zed , hoping to escape inside his mind while leaving its physical body still trapped in the planet . However , the Doctor smashes the power source of the prison , causing Krop Tor to be dragged into the black hole , and the Beast 's body bursts into flames . At that moment , while fleeing the planet in a spacecraft with his team , Toby , who is possessed by the Beast , angrily proclaims that as long as he was feared , he could never be destroyed . Rose Tyler , however , shoots out the cockpit window with a bolt gun , causing Toby , with the mind of the Beast , to be blown into the black hole . In present day Cardiff the Torchwood team encounters a similar giant creature named Abaddon , released from the Cardiff spacetime Rift , referred to as the son of the great Beast . Gabriel Woolf , who provides the Beast 's voice , also plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mars ' ' , an entity that is also said to have been named Satan . # Beep the Meep # # Bennett # # Black Guardian # # Margaret Blaine # : ' ' See : Blon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen # Bok # Bok is the gargoyle servant of Azal in the Third Doctor story ' ' The Dmons ' ' .

Each time , Borusa is portrayed by a different actor , it being implied that the character has regenerated in the time between these serials making his appearance and personality different in each story : * ' ' The Deadly Assassin ' ' - Angus MacKay * ' ' The Invasion of Time ' ' - John Arnatt * ' ' Arc of Infinity ' ' - Leonard Sachs * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the character is first introduced in ' ' The Deadly Assassin ' ' , he occupies the post of Cardinal in the High Council , and is portrayed as a good though pretentious person with some political standing on Gallifrey , the Time Lords ' home planet . He sets about adjusting truth in the wake of the Doctor 's return to Gallifrey and his defeat of the Master . He seeks , for instance , to portray the late Chancellor Goth not as the Master 's ally , but as a hero who has given his life to stop the Master . After the Doctor willingly leaves Gallifrey again , in the Doctor 's absence Borusa officially becomes Lord Chancellor ( although the Doctor later claims this was done illegally ) . Borusa appears again when the Doctor returns to Gallifrey briefly in ' ' The Invasion of Time ' ' to officially take up the post of Lord President . This is , however , part of a strategy to defeat the Vardans , and once they and the Sontarans have been seen off , the Doctor - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council of Time Lords - departs and leaves Gallifrey in the hands of Borusa once again . By the time of ' ' Arc of Infinity ' ' , Borusa has regenerated again and has officially become Lord President of Gallifrey . He , along with other members of the High Council of Time Lords , condemns the Fifth Doctor to death , as Omega has attempted to interface with this universe from his own anti-matter universe by using the Fifth Doctor as the bridge , thereby endangering the whole of creation . Borusa is even suspected of being the traitor who has sent Omega the Doctor 's genetic code ; however , he is quickly proven innocent and assisted the Doctor in destroying Omega . In ' ' The Five Doctors ' ' , Borusa has once again regenerated , which may have unbalanced his mind . He seeks , by using the Doctor 's first five incarnations , the Time Lord founder Rassilon 's fabled secret of immortality for himself so that he may rule Gallifrey forever . Borusa uses a Time Scoop to transport the Doctor ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using them to clear the way to the Dark Tower where Rassilon is entombed . History states that to share immortality , would-be challengers have to overcome the obstacles in the Death Zone and solve the Game of Rassilon by removing the ring from Rassilon 's hand . The Game is actually a trap to contain power-mad maniacs , since Rassilon reasons that immortality is a curse rather than a blessing and that anyone who seeks it is clearly deranged . Borusa is transformed into a living statue by Rassilon for his efforts . The spin off novels ' ' Blood Harvest ' ' and ' ' The Eight Doctors ' ' by Terrance Dicks feature further appearances by Borusa . In both novels Borusa is freed from his imprisonment and given a chance for redemption . In ' ' The Eight Doctors ' ' , he is released thanks to the appeal of the Eighth Doctor to help resolve the political conflict inspired by the Sixth Doctor 's trial in ' ' The Trial of a Time Lord ' ' .

It originated on the fifth planet of Earth 's solar system , which the ancient Time Lords placed in a time loop in an attempt to imprison the creature . However , the Fendahl escaped and , in the form of a humanoid skull , was buried under volcanic rock on prehistoric Earth 12 million years ago . The story of the Fendahl passed into Time Lord myth , and was forgotten . The Fendahl 's power , contained in a pentagram-shaped neural relay in the bones of the skull , affected life on Earth via a biotransmutation field , influencing life forms in its vicinity ( including the early hominids ) to develop into forms it could use . In the late 20th century , the Fendahl skull was discovered in Kenya by a team of anthropologists under the leadership of one Dr. Fendelman . Fendelman brought the skull to an English research facility at Fetch Priory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built on a time fissure , causing psychic ability in some nearby residents . In the Priory , Fendelman and his fellow researchers Thea Ransome , Adam Colby and Maximillian Stael performed experiments on the skull , attempting to unlock its secrets . Fendelman used a crude time scanner to examine the skull , a dangerous activity which drew the attention of the Fourth Doctor . Stael attempted to capture the power of the Fendahl for himself by means of black magic rituals , performed with the aid of a local coven , but he , Fendelman and Ransome were all being used by the Fendahl to recreate itself . The Fendahl was a gestalt creature with multiple aspects . Thea Ransome was transformed into the Fendahl Core , a humanoid female with golden skin and blank , staring eyes . Several of the cult members became slug-like creatures called Fendahleen . All the aspects of the Fendahl had powerful psychotelekinetic ability , and can control the muscles of human victims . The Fendahleen were vulnerable to sodium chloride , which altered the creatures ' conductivity and destroyed their electrical balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Core and twelve Fendahleen ; however , the Doctor was able to prevent the creature from reaching its full manifestation .

Taking the position of headmaster , Finch gradually replaced the staff members with disguised Krillitanes and then enacted a series of reforms , including specialised programmes of study and free , but compulsory , school dinners . The dinners were laced with Krillitane oil , which enhances the intelligence of the pupils so they could be used to decode the Skasis Paradigm , which would give the Krillitanes control over the structure of reality . The Krillitanes could not use the oil themselves because their constantly changing morphology had rendered it toxic to their systems .

Although he disapproved of using this , claiming it suffered from buildups of static electricity , Morbius insisted . Solon attached this to the patchwork body , and this time around , the plan worked . However , during the operation , when Condo went into a fury at seeing his missing arm attached to the body , Morbius ' brain was knocked to the floor , apparently causing Morbius further brain damage . The ghoulishly resurrected Morbius fought the Doctor in a series of violent encounters . Their final confrontation was a dangerous Time Lord mental contest called mind-bending . Although Morbius nearly won the confrontation , sending the Doctor into a coma , the strain caused his artificial braincase to overload , burning out his brain and leaving his body a berserk monster . The Sisterhood of Karn , longtime opponents of Morbius , chased the monster to a clifftop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then used the Elixir of Life ( a substance of which they were guardians ) to revive the Doctor .

In 2008 , Big Finish Productions resurrected Morbius for the Eighth Doctor stories Sisters of the Flame and Vengeance of Morbius . Morbius returns with help from Zarodnix , richest man in the Galaxy , who finds part of Morbius ' brain on Karn and uses the DNA of Time Lord Straxus to create a new body for Morbius . Morbius uses a Stellar Manipulator to drain power from the Eye of Harmony . Without the Time Lords able to stop him Morbius conquers many worlds , including Earth . However the Doctor is able to stop the power drain and the Time Lords prevent the Empire of Morbius forming .

When Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart defeated the Destroyer , Morgaine and Mordred attempted to detonate a nuclear missile that was in convoy . However , the Doctor persuaded Morgaine that there was no honour in killing with this modern weaponry and she realised her fight was futile when the Doctor informed her that King Arthur , her lover and foe , had been dead for over a thousand years . She and Mordred were locked up by Brigadier Bambera as punishment for their killings . # Trau Morgus # Morgus is the chairman of the Androzani Mining Corporation in ' ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly on the Spectrox drug which could be used to extend life .

He also built a secret underground lair in Australia with technology that allowed him to trigger volcanoes and earthquakes . The lair is staffed by scientists who believe the world has been irradiated by a nuclear war , and for some reason they must fight back against the surface by causing natural disasters . Salamander uses these disasters to his advantage he unseats one rival , Alexander Denes , the Controller of the Central European Zone , by causing a dormant volcano in Hungary to erupt and having Denes blamed for negligence . He then tries to force Denes 's deputy to poison him through blackmail . As the Second Doctor was identical to Salamander , an opposing faction sought the Doctor 's help to gain more evidence of his misdeeds . It later transpires that the group 's leader Giles Kent , the former Deputy Security Leader for North Africa and Europe who was undermined by Salamander , is just as power-hungry . He had previously worked with Salamander in developing the secret bunker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partick Troughton in a dual role . At the end of the story Salamander tries to flee justice in the TARDIS by impersonating the Doctor ; however , Jamie sees through his deception . Salamander is then sucked out of the ship when the TARDIS dematerialises with its doors open and is thrown into the time/space vortex # Scaroth # Scaroth was the last of the Jagaroth , a vicious and callous warlike race , appearing in the serial ' ' City of Death ' ' . The last Jagaroth spacecraft exploded upon takeoff on prehistoric Earth . The energy from that explosion ignited the primordial soup that led to life developing on Earth and also fractured Scaroth into 12 aspects , scattered throughout Earth 's history . Each splinter had the ability to communicate with the others , and disguising themselves as human , together they influenced Earth 's technological development to the point where the last Scaroth ( who had taken the alias of Count Scarlioni ) could construct a time machine , travelling into the past to prevent his ship from taking off and thus saving his species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves arranging for priceless art treasures to be passed down to Scarlioni . One such scheme involved his 1505 persona , Captain Tancredi , persuading Leonardo da Vinci to paint six copies of the Mona Lisa , so that in 1979 Scarlioni could steal the original from the Louvre and sell all seven copies on the black market . Sensing the fractures used by the time travel experiments , the Fourth Doctor and Romana stumbled upon Scaroth 's plans for the painting and foiled them . Scaroth used the prototype time bubble to travel back into the past anyway to stop his ship from taking off . However , Duggan , a private investigator who was aiding the two Time Lords , punched out Scaroth at the crucial moment . Scaroth was then sent back to 1979 where the time machine exploded , killing him . # Shadow # The Shadow appeared in the 1979 Fourth Doctor story ' ' The Armageddon Factor ' ' ; he was a servant of the Black Guardian , and at least partially responsible for a war between the planets Atrios and Zeos . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unstated , but when the Zeons either were wiped out by the Atrian attacks or abandoned their planet rather than continue the war , he had a Time Lord named Drax build a computer , Mentalis , which would co-ordinate the remaining Zeon forces . Once Drax completed work on Mentalis he realised just who he was working for , but was imprisoned by the Shadow so as not to disrupt his plan . The Shadow then hid on a space station in orbit of Zeos ( invisible to either the Atrians or Mentalis ) and waited for the Doctor to arrive . In the meantime , Mentalis was more successful in fighting the war than the Zeons and pushed the Atrians to the brink of defeat . The Shadow knew that the royal family of Atrios held the secret of the sixth segment of the Key to Time , and when the Fourth Doctor arrived he arranged for the Doctor and the last survivor of the family , Princess Astra to be kidnapped . With this done , the Shadow ordered Mentalis to cease its attacks and duped Atrios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear attack on Zeos the result of which would have been that Mentalis would set off an explosion powerful enough to destroy both planets . This was intended as a prelude to the Black Guardian 's ultimate plan , which would have been to plunge the universe into perpetual , unending war ; as the Shadow explained , they did not seek any political power , but revelled in death and destruction . Eventually the Shadow worked out that Astra herself was the sixth segment , and transformed her into the segment . Before he could attach it to the other five ( which he had stolen from the Doctor ) , the Doctor took the segments back and with Drax 's aid dismantled Mentalis . Finally , using the TARDIS , the Doctor set up a force field which diverted the Marshall 's missiles into the Shadow 's space station , destroying it . The Shadow perished in the explosion , but not before informing the Black Guardian of what had happened . # Sil # Sil is a fictional alien from the television series Doctor Who , first appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed by Nabil Shaban . Sil was the representative of the Galatron Mining Corporation present on the planet Varos to extract concessions from the current Governor . Unbeknownst to the Varosians , the mineral Zeiton-7 which was abundant on their planet was not as they thought nearly valueless , but in fact rare , particularly to time travellers . The Varosians lived barely above the poverty line due to the exploitation of companies like the Galatron Mining Corporation and others . Sil was a particularly vile creature by any standard , more so since a fault in his translation device made his voice sibilant , with a ululating laugh . Devoid of morality and dedicated to getting the cheapest price he could for Zeiton ore by any means , he also enjoyed the various tortures which passed for entertainment on Varos , taking particular delight in making the Sixth Doctor 's companion Peri suffer a transformation into an avian creature . The Doctor interfered with Sil 's plan and informed the Varosians of the true value of their natural resources , forcing Sil to concede to offer the true value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again on the planet Thoros Beta , where he was that time involved in arms dealing . At the end of the segment of evidence presented by the Valeyard in the Doctor 's trial , it appeared that Sil was killed by a rampaging King Yrcanos . It later transpired that the evidence of the Matrix had been tampered with , so it is not clear whether Sil in fact survived . Sil has been in 2 episodes the first called ' ' Vengeance on Varos ' ' and the second ' ' The Trial of a Time Lord ' ' . Sil also features in the Philip Martin 's novelisation of the never-made serial Mission to Magnus , in which he was in league with the Ice Warriors . Big Finish Productions released a new audio verion of Mission to Magnus in December 2009 , with Nabil Shaban reprising his role as Sil .

Seeking to evolve into the era 's dominant form , a highborn Victorian gentleman , Smith planned to seize power in the British Empire by assassinating Queen Victoria , having kidnapped famed explorer Redvers Fenn-Cooper to gain access via his association with her . He used the house to establish some social standing and drew further attention to himself in society by espousing heretical-seeming evolutionary theories , devolving the reverend sent from Oxford to silence him into an ape . His plans were thwarted when Light was reawakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team 's crew known as Control escaped Smith 's imprisonment .

There , he developed the techniques which enabled him to create a new body for the brain of Morbius , which had survived his execution . In an isolated castle on Karn , Solon was assisted by his simple servant Condo . Spaceships often crashed on the planet , and Solon constructed a horrendous patchwork body out of the alien survivors ' body parts . He planned to house Morbius ' brain in it . When the Fourth Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith arrived , Solon needed only a head to finish his monstrous creation , and hoped to use the Doctor 's . Sarah prevented this , and Solon was forced to use a glass bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas and blew it into his laboratory .

The eventual aim was galactic conquest using the best human soldiers , Earth having been targeted because human beings were considered the most savage race of all . The War Lord was assisted in this by the ' War Chief ' , a rogue Time Lord who was eventually executed by the War Lord 's guards for attempted betrayal . The War Lord was caught and tried by the Time Lords following the Doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until tortured with a painful light . After being briefly rescued by a squad of his guards who murdered two technicians he and his accomplices were sentenced to ' dematerialisation ' removal out of time , as if he never existed while his home planet and his people were locked forever behind a forcefield .

After the Filipino Army defeats the Supreme Alliance at the battle of Reykjavik , Greel flees to 19th century China by means of a time cabinet which utilises zygma beam technology , taking The Peking Homunculus with him . There he is given shelter by a peasant , Li H'sen Chang , who believes Greel to be the god Weng-Chiang . However , the zygma beam has disrupted Greel 's DNA , hideously deforming him and requiring him to draw the life essence from kidnapped young women in order to live . The time cabinet is captured by Imperial soldiers and passed on to an Englishman , Professor George Litefoot , as a gift , neither of whom knows its true nature . Seeking to recover the cabinet and reverse his condition , Greel and Li pursue it to London , where Li poses as a stage magician .

Other consequences of Greel 's time travel are explored in the spin-off Virgin Missing Adventures novel ' ' The Shadow of Weng-Chiang ' ' by David A. McIntee , in which the Doctor again encounters the Tong of the Black Scorpion as a group attempt to draw Greel 's cabinet into the present to torture him for his crimes , unaware that this will result in a dangerous temporal paradox .

There , it concealed itself in television signals , transferring itself from set to set and feeding on the electrical activity of the brains of those watching it . The faces of its victims were completely erased and their brains drained of neural energy , leaving them mindless . The Wire used the image of a BBC continuity announcer to communicate with the outside world . She screamed the phrase ' ' Hungry ! ' ' when she wanted to eat . The Wire used Mr. Magpie , the owner of an electronics shop , to distribute cheap television sets in North London so it could feed . It planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of the coronation of Elizabeth II , where it could reach out and drain the collective energy of the estimated 20 million viewers watching the event so it could manifest itself once more .

The Doctor then claims that he might erase her from existence by taping over her . # X # # Queen Xanxia # # Xoanon # Xoanon was a malevolent artificial intelligence encountered by the Fourth Doctor in ' ' The Face of Evil ' ' ( 1977 ) . Xoanon was inadvertently created by the Doctor on a previous visit to its unnamed planet centuries prior , when he had programmed the computer belonging to a Mordee expedition that had crashed on the planet . The Doctor forgot to wipe his personality print from the computer 's data core , and as a result the computer developed multiple personalities , half of them based on the Doctor himself . For generations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their control and became almost a living creature . It utilised the appearance of the Fourth Doctor , to the extent of having an effigy in the Doctor 's image carved out on a cliff-face . Its split personality was reflected in it dividing the expedition into two tribes of technicians ( who became the Tesh ) and the survey team ( the Sevateem ) , justifying its madness by thinking it was part of an experiment to create a superhuman race , with the Tesh providing mental powers and the Sevateem with their strength and independence . Enslaving the tribes , it earned the name of The Evil One . When the Doctor returned to the maddened world and saw the fruits of his mistakes , Xoanon tried to destroy itself and the entire planet rather than be defeated by the Doctor . However , the Doctor managed to remove his personality print from the core , restoring the computer intelligence to sanity and becoming a benign entity to the two tribes . You have to trust someone eventually , the Doctor says . # Y # # Professor Yana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mad scientist who planned to destroy the world in the 1967 Second Doctor story ' ' The Underwater Menace ' ' .

As part of his diabolical plans , he allied himself with the leaders of Atlantis telling them he would raise their city back to the surface or lower the ocean level by draining the water through a fissure in the Earth 's crust . The Doctor immediately realised that this would create super heated steam that could destroy the Earth . Zaroff was defeated when the Doctor and his companions sabotaged the generator he was using to pump the water . Zaroff was left to drown when his laboratory filled with water after the sea walls protecting it collapsed .
