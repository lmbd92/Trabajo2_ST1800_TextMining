@@6794514 ' ' Dearest Christian , I 'm So Very Sorry for Bringing You Here . Love , Dad ' ' is the fourth studio album by American musical duo P.M. Dawn . It was released on October 6 , 1998 , by Gee Street and V2 Records . The album 's title refers to bandmember Attrell Cordes 's newborn son , named Christian . # Critical reception # In a contemporary review , ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' magazine called ' ' Dearest Christian ' ' a bleak record that contains the duo 's smoothest work since 1993 's ' ' The Bliss Album ... ? ' ' and a masterfully romantic album with no stomach for rhapsodic lies . Keith Phipps of ' ' The A.V. Club ' ' wrote that the album confirms the group as one of the most extraordinarily novel acts around . Robert Christgau , writing in ' ' The Village Voice ' ' , felt that Prince Be composed better as an R&amp;B songwriter for the album than on ' ' Jesus Wept ' ' and stated , with a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riff , he revives his spaced-out spirituality as music if not commodity , transfiguring his grumpy disillusion with melodies , vocal harmonies , and now also guitar parts , all lovingly designed to convince his son Christian to be here now . In a negative review , ' ' NME ' ' magazine found the music boring and described it as fluffy-smooth to the point of suffocation ; so unswervingly gushy it quickly drives you to distraction . In a retrospective review , Allmusic 's Ned Raggett said that some of the songs sound derivative of one another , but that the album contains beauty , ambition , good songs , rich production , and more , enough to justify its existence when so many of the band 's peers had run themselves into the ground . # Track listing # # Music for Carnivores <small> ( Attrell Cordes , Roy Phillips ) </small> 4:34 # Art Deco Halos <small> ( Cordes , Marc Bolan ) </small> 3:32 # Being So Not for You ( I Had No Right ) <small> ( Cordes , Clark Anderson ) </small> 5:26 # Misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Could Be Your Star <small> ( Cordes ) </small> 4:41 # Yang : As Private I 's <small> ( Cordes ) </small> 4:25 # Screaming at Me <small> ( Cordes ) </small> 4:53 # I Hate Myself for You <small> ( Cordes ) </small> 4:21 # No Further Damage <small> ( Cordes , J.
