@@4110514 The Lotus Mark I was the first car designed and built by Colin Chapman in 1948 , while Chapman was still a student at the University of London . The car was designed to compete as a trials car , and was constructed on an Austin 7 chassis and running gear and given registration number OX 9292 . Chapman built the body utilizing a composite made of thin aluminum bonded to plywood . He modified the rear suspension to give better handling and the engine to give more power . His approach to automobile construction using sound engineering principles and ingenious chassis design set the stage for many more revolutionary designs to follow . Although the original Mark I has been lost to history , a replica ( see photo ) was created to the same dimensions that uses an identical Austin chassis and running gear . Chapman and his future wife competed with the car in English Trials , a form of competition over rough terrain against time . Chapman continued to develop and modify the Mark I. First larger wheels and tyres were fitted and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide independent front suspension . The success of the car helped encourage Chapman to continue designing competition cars . # Further reading # * Tipler , John , ' ' Lotus and Caterham Seven : Racers for the Road ' ' The Crowood Press , 1995. pp. 1314. * Coulter , Jeremy , ' ' The Lotus &amp; Caterham Seven : A Collector 's Guide ' ' Motor Racing Publications , 1986. p 9. * Wliiam Taylor , ' ' The Lotus Book : The Complete History of Lotus Cars ' ' Coterie Press , Limited , 1998 , pp. 1213.
