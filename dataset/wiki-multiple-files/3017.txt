@@26892514 RocketMotorTwo is a hybrid rocket engine being developed for the Scaled Composites SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane . The engine is being designed and built by Sierra Nevada Corporation ( SNC ) , and was first ignited in flight during a SpaceShipTwo test launch in April 2013. # Description # RocketMotorTwo is a throttleable hybrid rocket engine fueled with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene ( HTPB ) and nitrous oxide sometimes referred to as an N <sub> 2 </sub> O/HTPB engine providing 60000 lbf of thrust . # Background # , Sierra Nevada has performed over 300 hybrid rocket test firings . The company also developed the rocket engine for the first private spacecraft to reach space , SpaceShipOne , which won the Ansari X-Prize in 2004 . Sierra Nevada is furthermore developing a similar hybrid engine , the Dream Chaser rocket engine . # Development history # # Hot-fire ground tests # Scaled Composites performed a series of subscale rocket hot-firings between June 2005 and April 2009 , before choosing a full-scale rocket motor design . By December 2012 , 21 full-scale hot-fire ground tests had been carried out on RocketMotorTwo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control of SpaceShipTwo 's proprietary Rocket Motor Controller ( RMC ) was successfully conducted . # Test program accident # On 26 July 2007 , during the early rocket testing phase , an explosion occurred during a propellant flow test at the Mojave Air and Space Port . The test included filling the oxidizer tank with 4,500 kg ( 10,000 pounds ) of nitrous oxide , followed by a 15-second cold flow injector test . Although the tests did not ignite the gas , three employees were killed and three injured , two critically and one seriously , by flying shrapnel . # Commencement of flight testing # In July 2012 , Virgin Galactic , the owner of VSS ' ' Enterprise ' ' the first SpaceShipTwo spaceplane built announced that RocketMotorTwo was fully qualified for powered flight , and that the ground test program was substantially complete . SpaceShipTwo conducted its first gliding test flight with the engine fully installed in December 2012 . Additional ground rocket tests continued into March 2013 as the company prepared for powered test flights . VSS ' ' Enterprise ' ' conducted its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first flight test of RocketMotorTwo . The test was a 16-second burn as planned , and was ignited at an altitude of , shortly after ' ' Enterprise ' ' was released from its WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft and the pilots cross-checked data and verified stable control . The RM2 control system opened the main oxidizer valve and fired the igniters inside the fuel case . The burn was completed at an altitude of , by which point ' ' Enterprise ' ' was supersonic , achieving 1.2Mach 55,000 . SNC stated after the test that The rocket motor ignition went as planned , with the expected burn duration , and good engine performance . # 2014 Change of fuel # In May 2014 , Virgin Galactic announced a change to the fuel to be used in the SpaceShipTwo rocket engine . Rather than the rubber-based HTPBHTPB engines had experienced serious engine stability issues on firings longer than approximately 20 secondsthe engine will now use a type of plastic called thermoplastic polyamide as the solid fuel . The plastic fuel is projected to have better performance ( by several unspecified measures ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude . , the new engine formulation has already completed full-duration burns of over 60 seconds in ground tests on an engine test stand . However , four additional ground tests of the polyamide-fueled engine are anticipated before the SpaceShipTwo flight test could resume with the new-fuel rocket motor . # Production # The hybrid rocket motor and its oxidizer valve system are produced in SNCs manufacturing facility in Poway , California in conjunction with Scaled Composites . In 2013 , the Poway facility was reported to be currently producing motors for both SpaceShipTwo and SNCs own Dream Chaser orbital crew vehicle .
