@@19098514 The Animalize Tour was a concert tour by American band Kiss in support of their ' ' Animalize ' ' album . It was divided into two halves : the European leg and the U.S. leg , with two very different shows and stage sets . The European staging was essentially the Unmasked Tour stage , decorated to resemble the ' ' Animalize ' ' album cover ( amps painted with leopard spots and tiger stripes ) . One short-lived prop saw two growling panthers covering Eric Carr 's bass drums . When ' ' Animalize ' ' became a surprise hit in America , a much larger stage set was designed for the American leg of the tour by Tait Towers . The shows would start much in the same manner as the Dynasty show , with the band being lifted onto the stage by a lift behind the drum riser . Sound effects of a large airplane landing would be played over the speakers while the band was coming up , and after the famous You Wanted The Best intro the band would launch into Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kulick on lead guitar , replacing Mark St. John who could n't play due to his arthritic condition . Originally Kulick was a temporary replacement , but St. John 's condition did not improve , and Kulick was named an official member on December 8 , 1984 . Bon Jovi was the opening act on the European leg , with Queensrche , WASP and Krokus opening shows in North America . The ' ' Animalize ' ' period was the band 's most successful of the decade with the crossover success of Heaven 's on Fire onto CHR/Top 40 radio , a very well-attended concert trek , and with ' ' Animalize ' ' selling nearly 2 million copies by the end of the tour . # Tour notes # * I 've Had Enough ( Into The Fire ) , Get All You Can Take and Burn Bitch Burn were all performed at the opening show in Brighton , England . Get All You Can Take would never be performed live again , while I 've Had Enough ( Into The Fire ) would continue to make sporadic appearances through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be performed only once , being played on opening night . *Eric Carr would handle lead vocals on Young and Wasted at all shows . In a 1989 interview just prior to the release of ' ' Hot in the Shade ' ' , Eric was quoted as saying that the Animalize Tour was his favorite with Kiss . *Mark St. John made his final appearance with Kiss at the December 7 show in Fort Wayne , Indiana . During a meeting in Fort Wayne later that night , St. John was fired and Bruce Kulick was named the band 's new guitarist . *Footage from the December 8 show in Detroit was used for an episode of MTV 's ' ' Saturday Night Concerts ' ' series . A more complete , but still heavily edited ( and overdubbed ) version of the show would be released by RCA/MusicVision as ' ' Kiss : Animalize Live Uncensored ' ' in April . This show was also broadcast live it its entirety on a local FM radio station . Furthermore , Heaven 's on Fire from this concert was included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LP. *Footage for the Thrills in the Night music video was shot at the December 14 &amp; 15 shows in Cleveland and Louisville. *Tragedy hit on the January 3 , 1985 show in Greenville , South Carolina when local lighting tech John Addington fell to his death during the changeover between openers Krokus and Kiss . *A rare snowstorm nearly canceled the February 1 show in Waco , Texas . The decision to proceed with the concert was literally made minutes before show time . # European setlist # * Detroit Rock City * Cold Gin * Strutter * Fits Like a Glove * Heaven 's on Fire * Under the Gun * War Machine * Young and Wasted * Creatures of the Night * I Love It Loud * I Still Love You * I 've Had Enough ( Into the Fire ) * Love Gun * Rock and Roll All Nite * Lick It Up * Black Diamond # North American setlist # * Detroit Rock City * Cold Gin * Creatures of the Night * Fits Like a Glove * Heaven 's on Fire * Thrills In The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wasted * I Love It Loud * I Still Love You * Love Gun * Lick It Up * Black Diamond * Rock and Roll All Nite * A few bars of Strutter were performed at the 3/28/85 show in Springfield , Massachusetts . # Tour dates # # References
