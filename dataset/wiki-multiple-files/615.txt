The episode was written by writing team Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan , who had written episodes for the show in the first season including Mind Over Murder . This was the first episode to have Mila Kunis providing the voice of Meg . Lacey Chabert , the original voice of Meg , left the series due to time constraints with her acting role in ' ' Party of Five ' ' , as well as schoolwork . Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character , in part due to her performance on ' ' That ' 70s Show ' ' . Seth MacFarlane , the show 's creator , called Kunis back after her first audition , instructing her to speak slower , and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more . Once she claimed that she had it under control , MacFarlane hired her . Ernie the Giant Chicken was introduced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a rival to Peter .

In addition to the regular cast , actress Victoria Principal , comedian and actor Will Sasso , reporter , commentator , war correspondent , anchorman Jack Perkins , voice actor Joey Slotnick , and character actor Patrick Duffy guest starred in the episode . Recurring guest voice actress Lori Alan , writer Danny Smith , and actor Patrick Warburton also made minor appearances .

Chris tells E.T . to run when he thinks Peter is the government coming for him . When travelling to find food they are stopped and there 's a reference to ' ' Family Feud ' ' . Stewie 's line , Game over man ! Game over ! is a nod to the science fiction film ' ' Aliens ' ' . Arriving at the Twinkie factory , Peter uses the same words to describe what he sees that Dr. Elle Arroway used in ' ' Contact ' ' when witnessing a celestial event in a foreign galaxy . # Reception # Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode a 10/10 , saying Overall , this episode easily ranks as one of the best in the series . Almost every joke succeeds , and the far-fetched alternate reality storyline thoroughly entertains . Despite the fact that all of the events in the episode are revealed to be a dream , it does n't take away from the high degree of amusement provided .
