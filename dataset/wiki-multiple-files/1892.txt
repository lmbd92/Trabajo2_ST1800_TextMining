@@14236514 rescatchment = Ryan Dam is a hydroelectric dam on the Missouri River , ten miles ( 16 km ) downstream from the city of Great Falls in the U.S. state of Montana . The dam is 1336 ft long and 61 ft high ; its reservoir is 7 mi long and has a storage capacity of . It is a run-of-river dam . The dam is built on the largest of the five Great Falls of the Missouri , and these specific falls are also called Great Falls . Since 1915 , the six-unit powerhouse on the left side of the dam has occupied a significant portion of the 87ft m high waterfall . The dam , built just upstream of the falls and a small island named Ryan Island , is divided into two parts . On the right side of the dam is a concrete-arch spillway structure , that when functioning , releases water over the remains of the waterfall . The center part of the dam consists of a dike that extends from the falls ' base to Ryan Island ( separating the tailrace from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards downstream ) . It also contains a concrete gravity structure facing towards the right bank of the river and tilted to face slightly downstream . This segment of the dam contains the outlet works , a water jet that bursts out and cascades over the waterfall . The left side of the dam is a large powerhouse topped by a concrete gravity structure . Since the dam 's construction in the Missouri River gorge , it has flooded a fair portion of the Great Falls - the cascades between Grand Fall and Crooked Falls , which lies several miles upstream - and reduced the flow over Great Falls to such an extent that much of the bedrock is visible . The dam was constructed on top of a 10ft m cascade that Lewis and Clark observed to lie just upstream of Grand Fall . Upstream of Ryan Dam the next dam is Cochrane Dam , then Rainbow Dam , and the uppermost is Black Eagle Dam . Downstream of Ryan Dam the next dam is Morony Dam .
