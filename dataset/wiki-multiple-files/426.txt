@@1494514 Giovanni Brusca ( born February 20 , 1957 in San Giuseppe Jato ) is a former member of the Sicilian Mafia . He murdered the anti-Mafia prosecutor Giovanni Falcone in 1992 and once stated that he had committed between 100 and 200 murders but was unable to remember the exact number . He was sentenced to life in prison ' ' in absentia ' ' , captured in 1996 and started to cooperate with the authorities . A pudgy , bearded and unkempt mafioso , Brusca was known in Mafia circles as ' ' U ' Verru ' ' ( in Sicilian ) or ' ' Il Porco ' ' or ' ' Il Maiale ' ' , ( In Italian : The Pig , The Swine ) or lo scannacristiani ( people-slayer ; in Italian dialects the word christians often stands for human beings ) . Tommaso Buscetta , the Mafia turncoat who had cooperated with Falcones investigations , remembered Giovanni Brusca as a wild stallion but a great leader . # Mafia career # Born in San Giuseppe Jato , Giovanni Brusca seems to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great-grandfather , both farmers , were made members of the Mafia . His father Bernardo Brusca , a local Mafia patriarch , served concurrent life sentences for numerous homicides . Bernardo Brusca allied himself with the Corleonesi of Salvatore Riina and Bernardo Provenzano when he replaced Antonio Salamone as capo mandamento of San Giuseppe Jato , paving the way for his three sons careers apart from Giovanni , his younger brother Vincenzo and elder brother Emanuele in Cosa Nostra 's most powerful and ruthless clan . By the age of 20 , Brusca was reportedly working as a driver for Bernardo Provenzano . All the pentiti have described him as a kind of butcher with a lot of instinct and little charisma , says longtime Mafia observer Francesco La Licata , a journalist working for La Stampa newspaper . Giovanni Brusca became part of a Corleonesi death squad which reported directly to Riina . He became capo mandamento of San Giuseppe Jato after the arrest of his father in 1989. # Ruthless killer # Nothing better demonstrated Brusca 's ruthlessness than the kidnapping and murder of 11-year-old Giuseppe Di Matteo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took part in the 1992 Falcone killing and , following his arrest , under the pentito system named others involved in the plot . Brusca had the boy kidnapped in November 1993 . According to the confession of one of the kidnappers , Gaspare Spatuzza , they dressed as police officers and told the boy he was being taken to see his father , who at that time was being kept under police protection on mainland Italy . Instead they held the boy for 26 months , during which time they tortured him and sent grisly photos to his father in an attempt to force him to retract his testimony . Di Matteo made a desperate trip to Sicily to try to negotiate his son 's release but the boy was finally strangled on the orders of Brusca . Subsequently he had the body dissolved in a barrel of acid to prevent the family being able to mourn at a proper funeral . This deliberate added indignity of concealing or destroying the victim 's body is known colloquially as the lupara bianca . It also hinders investigation by destroying evidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Di Matteo told the judge : I guarantee my collaboration but to this animal I guarantee nothing . If you leave me alone with him for two minutes I 'll cut off his head . Giovanni Brusca was one of the most powerful Mafia leaders between Riinas arrest in January 1993 and his own in May 1996 . He was involved in the campaign of terror in 1993 against the state to get them to back off in their crackdown against the Mafia after the murders of Anti-mafia magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino . Following the months after Riina 's arrest , there were a series of bombings by the Corleonesi against several tourist spots on the Italian mainland the Via dei Georgofili in Florence , Via Palestro in Milan and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano and Via San Teodoro in Rome , which left 10 people dead and 71 injured as well as severe damage to centres of cultural heritage such as the Uffizi Gallery . # Arrest # On May 20 , 1996 , then aged thirty-nine , Brusca was arrested in a small house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his girlfriend , their young son and his brother Vincenzo , his sister-in-law and their two children . The investigators were able to pinpoint their exact location when the noise of a plainclothes officer driving by the house on a motorbike was picked up by officers listening to a call intercepted on Brusca 's cellular phone . When Brusca was hurried into Palermo 's police station some 90 minutes after the arrest , dozens of police officers cheered , honked their horns and embraced each other . As the scruffy-bearded Brusca emerged from a car , clad in dirty jeans and a rumpled white shirt , some ripped off their ski masks , as if to say they no longer had anything to fear from the Mafia . One reportedly managed to slip past guards and punched Brusca in the face . Brusca had received a life sentence the previous year after being convicted ' ' in absentia ' ' of murder and he was subsequently convicted of the bomb attack that killed the Anti-Mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone near Capaci .

Initially , his collaboration met with scepticism , fearing his ' repentance ' could be a ruse to escape the harsh prison terms reserved for ranking Mafia bosses . Under question was whether the state should offer not only protection but also a salary and the promise of judicial leniency to a man nicknamed U Verru ( The Pig ) , who had punished a Mafia pentito by dissolving the body of his 11-year-old son in an acid bath . In the first three months , much of what Brusca said turned out to be either unverifiable or false , and a growing chorus of politicians called for a tightening of the whole collaboration system . Despite having confessed numerous murders and other criminal activities , he was not granted the status of full collaborator until February 1999 . Until that time Brusca was described as a ' ' dichiarante ' ' , or talking witness . Although much of his evidence eventually was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was part of a strategy to emasculate other pentiti and subvert the course of justice . Brusca has offered a controversial version of the capture of Tot Riina : a secret deal between Carabinieri officers , secret agents and Cosa Nostra bosses tired of the dictatorship of the Corleonesi . According to Brusca , Bernardo Provenzano sold Riina in exchange for the valuable archive of compromising material that Riina held in his apartment in Via Bernini 52 in Palermo . Brusca also claimed that Riina had told him that after the assassination of Falcone , he had been in indirect negotiations with interior minister Nicola Mancino on a deal to prevent any further killings . Mancino later said this was not true , but in July 2012 , Mancino was ordered to stand trial for withholding evidence on 1992 talks between the Italian state and the Mafia and the killings of Falcone and Borsellino .

It restores property confiscated from imprisoned mafiosi and gives them back to the community . The small stone farmhouse at San Giuseppe Jato some 40 minutes from Palermo was renovated in 2004 . It is Sicilys first anti-mafia agriturismo or farmstay . Tourists can enjoy organic pasta milled from wheat grown on Bruscas land and organic wine made from his vineyards by the Placido Rizzotto cooperative , named after the union leader from Corleone , who was shot by the mafia in 1948 . According to Lucio Guarino , the organizations director , returning the properties sends a powerful message : The Brusca family controlled the fortunes of this territory for nearly thirty years .
