@@2956514 The last two of the 842 LMS Stanier Black Fives , numbers 44686 and 44687 were constructed by British Railways at Horwich Works in 1951 . They were fitted with Caprotti valve gear , raised running plates without splashers , a double chimney and SKF roller bearings on all axles . Caprotti valve gear had previously been fitted to a batch of twenty Black Fives , nos. 44738-57 , built in 1948 . The valve gear on these was driven by one drive-line between the frames , driven from the leading coupled axle . Although these locomotives developed a great deal of power at high speeds and were free in coasting , acceleration at low speeds was poor . 44686 and 44687 were fitted with a modified form of valve gear , with an external shaft on each side , driven by a worm gear mounted on a flycrank attached to the driving axle . The British Caprotti valve gear was a new development of Caprotti valve gear by the Associated Locomotive Engineers , under the leadership of L.A. Daniels . 44686 and 44687 emerged from Horwich works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost 20,642 each , over 5,000 more than a contemporary standard Class Five . This was in part because of the high cost of development for a type of which only two examples were built . For much of their lives they were allocated to Longsight. 44686 was withdrawn in October 1965. 44687 was withdrawn in January 1966 . Both were scrapped . in the early 1960s both 44686 and 44687 worked off Southport shed ( code 27C ) on passenger trains from Southport to Manchester and Rochdale via Bolton . Other non-standard LMSR 5MTs were at Southport including LMSR Caprottis and the unique Stephenson Link machine 44767 . The success of the British Caprotti valve gear lead to its fitting to the final batch of BR standard class 5s and also to the solitary BR standard class 8 71000 ' ' Duke of Gloucester ' ' . One of the Caprotti standard fives survives(73129) , as does ' ' The Duke ' ' .
