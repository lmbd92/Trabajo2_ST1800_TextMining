It was in one of the Subiaco caves that Benedict made his first hermitage . The monastery today gives its name to the Subiaco Congregation , a grouping of monasteries worldwide that makes up part of the Order of Saint Benedict . # History # In the early 6th century Benedict of Nursia , a man from a well-to-do family who was educated at Rome , retired to an ancient Roman villa in a grotto in Subiaco , in the mountains of north Latium . His reputation as a spiritual guide quickly drew disciples to him there , including many of his old Roman friends , who also settled in the area . Over the years , no fewer than thirteen monastic communities arose around Subiaco , including the one that would come to be named for St. Scholastica , Benedict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater solitude , Benedict would retire to Monte Cassino , where the same process would be repeated . In the ninth century , St. Scholastica 's Abbey was twice destroyed by the Saracens , in 828-829 and 876-877 . But it was restored , and grew in the tenth century thanks to the patronage and favour of several popes , many of whom were , in fact , Benedictine monks . As for monastic establishments throughout Europe , the eleventh and twelfth centuries were a golden age for the abbey , when it boasted vast lands , a large number of monks , and elaborate , ornate liturgy . With economic power came political power as well . In the thirteenth century , a sanctuary was erected over the cave where St. Benedict had dwelt , the ' ' Sacro Speco ' ' or Holy Cave . Riches also brought covetousness , and the abbey 's prestige brought it enemies .

Rodrigo Borgia ( later the infamous Alexander VI held the commendatory abbacy in 1467 . The Colonna ( 1492 ) , Borghese ( 1608 ) , and Barberini ( 1633 ) families would also gain control of its revenues . Some took their ownership of the abbey seriously and tried to restore it , but most were content to exploit its revenues , sometimes without even ever visiting the monastery . The spiritual well-being of the monks was rarely a concern . The tide began to turn in 1753 , when Benedict XIV decided to remove commendatory abbots ' power over the day-to-day running of their monasteries , leaving them only the spiritual and ecclesiastical dignity . Yet at the end of the century , when the French occupied the Papal States , the abbey was suppressed . Pius VII restored it as soon as he regained his independence . In 1915 , Benedict XV accorded it the privilege of a territorial abbey . # Today # The monastic community today is made up of a little over twenty monks , including eleven priest-monks , living in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monks ) , and the ' ' Sacro Speco ' ' ( ' ' Holy Cave ' ' ) , the sanctuary to , which can also be visited by pilgrims . # St. Scholastica 's Abbey # * The buildings are arranged around three cloisters .
