@@4376514 The Set-n-Forget deep fryer was designed by the influential Australian racing car designer John Joyce of Bowin Cars fame . In the early 1970s when the demand for racing cars declined in Australia , the Bowin Car company was forced to change its direction from Formula racing cars to commercial goods market . John Joyce believed that typical deep fryer systems were wasteful because they did nt control portion size and in some cases drained poorly . He also felt it was costly for staff to be standing around tending to the deep-frying food , especially if they are letting a steak burn . He hoped by automating the frying process he could eliminate some of these shortcomings . It is believed this was the first ever automated deep fryer invented and actively marketed for sale . Unfortunately , the new type of automated deep fryer did not reach product uptake expectations and the Australian company ceased production of the machines in the mid to late 1970s . Currently no documentation exists detailing the reasons the innovative concept failed to penetrate the commercial catering and kitchen markets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frying times . *Each canister takes it turn to pass through the cooking medium , rotating as it goes to ensure agitation of the food and therefore even cooking of each serve . When perfectly cooked , the food is drained and the canister rolls into a holding section , within the food stays hot for at least eight minutes . *Cost of running is extremely low and the machine can produce up to 180 servings of chips per hour . # Technical data # class= wikitable !
