@@2646514 Aulus Cluentius Habitus , a wealthy citizen of Larinum in Samnium , and subject of a Roman ' ' cause clbre ' ' . In 74 BC he accused his stepfather Statius Albius Oppianicus of an attempt to poison him ; had it been successful , the property of Cluentius would have fallen to his mother Sassia . Oppianicus was found guilty . It is almost certain that both sides attempted to bribe the jury Cicero , ' ' In Verrem ' ' II . The case became notorious as an example of a prosecutor obtaining a guilty verdict through his money . In 66 BC , Sassia induced her stepson Oppianicus to charge Cluentius with having poisoned the elder Oppianicus . The prosecutor in the trial was Titus Accius . The defense was undertaken by Cicero ; his extant speech ' ' Pro Cluentio ' ' , written up after the trial , is regarded as a model of oratory and Latin prose .

Most of the speech concerns the earlier trial and supposed prejudice surrounding it the word ' ' invidia ' ' is constantly repeated ; Cicero claims this is strictly irrelevant to his case . He presents Oppianicus as a monster who killed many members of his own family , Sassia as a stock figure of female wickedness . He then declares that either Cluentius or Oppianicus bribed the earlier court ; and having proven that Oppianicus did so , claims that Cluentius was innocent of bribery . The judges who voted for Oppianicus 's condemnation did so because they thought he was not going to fulfil his promise to pay them . Cicero deals at length with earlier verdicts quoted against Cluentius , offers a fairly brief rebuttal of the charge of poisoning and finishes with a rousing peroration .
