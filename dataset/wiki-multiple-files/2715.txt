It performed well in trials but it was not ordered into production . # Development # The Ferret was designed to meet a Fleet Air Arm requirement defined by specification 37/22 for a reconnaissance aircraft ; it was the company 's first all-metal design . With a lack of interest from the FAA the company proposed the design to meet a Royal Air Force requirement for a general-purpose biplane . The company built three prototypes , two were three-seaters ( to meet the naval requirement ) and the third was a two-seater . The two-seater Ferret III was also fitted with a new Fairey-designed high-speed gun mounting in the rear cockpit . The first prototype first flew in June 1925 powered by a 400hp ( 298kW ) Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar IV radial engine . The other two aircraft had a 9 inch extension to the wing span and were both fitted with a 425hp ( 317kW ) Bristol Jupiter radial engine .
