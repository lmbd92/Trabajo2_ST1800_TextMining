@@23061514 ' ' Smith and Snipes Hall Farm Ltd v River Douglas Catchment Board ' ' 1949 2 KB 500 is an English land law and English contract law case , notable for Denning LJ 's views concerning privity of contract . # Facts # The River Douglas Catchment Board agreed with a number of landowners between the River Douglas and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal ) to carry out some work if some contribution to the cost was given . In 1940 Mrs S , one of the covenantees , sold her land ( Low Meadows ) to Smith , which incorporated Snipes Hall Farm Ltd in 1944 . In Autumn 1946 the Ellen Brook burst its banks and flooded Smith and Snipes Hall Farm land . They made a claim against the Board for damages in tort and breach of contract . The question was whether not having been privy to the original agreement was a bar to any recovery . # Judgment # The Court of Appeal all held that the Board was in breach of contract , and that breach caused damage to the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attach to the land , and it would not matter whose hands the land came into : the owner could enforce the covenant . Because the covenant ran with the land , under section 78 Law of Property Act 1925 it could be enforced by the covenantee and successors in title . Denning LJ 's notable decision went as follows . On those facts it is my opinion that the board broke their contract . It was an implied term that they should do the work with reasonable care and skill , so as to make the banks reasonably fit for the purpose of preventing flooding . The proper way of doing this , according to the experts , was to put a clay core in the banks , or to make them very much wider , but they did not do either . It may be that the board had not sufficient funds available to carry out such works ; but that seems to me to be an irrelevant consideration , or , at any rate , just as irrelevant in the case of a public board as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engaged to make works for a specific purpose could excuse himself for bad results by saying that he had not sufficient money to erect proper works . It follows , therefore , that if the original landowner with whom the agreement was made had himself cultivated the fields , and suffered damage by the breach , he could recover from the board . But he sold the land and he has suffered no damage . The damage has been suffered partly by the man who purchased the land , but principally by the tenants , and the question is whether they can sue on the contract . Mr. Nield says that the plaintiffs can not sue . He says that there is no privity of contract between them and the board , and that it is a fundamental principle that no one can sue upon a contract to which he is not a party . That argument can be met either by admitting the principle and saying that it does not apply to this case , or by disputing the principle itself . I make so bold as to dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is sometimes supposed to be . It did not become rooted in our law until the year 1861 ( ' ' Tweddle v Atkinson ' ' , and reached its full growth in 1915 ( ' ' Dunlop v Selfridge ' ' ) . It has never been able entirely to supplant another principle whose roots go much deeper . I mean the principle that a man who makes a deliberate promise which is intended to be binding , that is to say , under seal or for good consideration , must keep his promise ; and the court will hold him to it , not only at the suit of the party who gave the consideration , but also at the suit of one who was not a party to the contract , provided that it was made for his benefit and that he has a sufficient interest to entitle him to enforce it , subject always , of course , to any defences that may be open on the merits . It is upon this principle , implicit if not expressed ( i. ) that the courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the owner of land for its benefit can be enforced against the covenantor , not only by the original party , but also by his successors in title . ( See ' ' The Prior 's case ' ' , which is set out by Lord Coke in his work on Littleton , at p. 384a , and in his report of ' ' Spencer 's case ' ' ) ; ( ii. ) that the Courts of Common Law in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries repeatedly enforced promises expressly made in favour of an interested person ; ( See ' ' Dutton v Poole ' ' , approved by Lord Mansfield in ' ' Martyn v Hind ' ' ) ; ( iii. ) that Lord Mansfield held that an undisclosed principal is entitled to sue on a contract made by his agent for his benefit , even though nothing was said about agency in the contract ; ( See ' ' Rabone v Williams ' ' cited in ' ' George v Clagett ' ' ) ; and ( iv. ) that Lord Hardwicke decided that a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the contract an intention by one of the parties to contract as trustee for him , even though nothing was said about any trust in the contract , and there was no trust fund to be administered . ( See ' ' Tomlinson v Gill ' ' . ) Throughout the history of the principle the difficulty has been , of course , to say what is sufficient interest to entitle the third person to recover . It has sometimes been supposed that there must always be something in the nature of a trust for his benefit . ( See ' ' Vandepitte 's case ' ' . ) But this is an elusive test which does not explain all the cases , and it involves the trustee being made a nominal party to the action either as plaintiff or defendant , unless that formality is dispensed with , as it was in ' ' Les Affrteurs Runis Socit Anonyme v Leopold Walford Ltd ' ' . The truth is that the principle is not so limited . It may be difficult to define what is a sufficient interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public disadvantage , it does cover the protection of the legitimate property , rights and interests of the third person , although no agency or trust for him can be inferred . It covers , therefore , rights such as these which can not justly be denied ; the right of a seller to enforce a commercial credit issued in his favour by a bank , under contract with the buyer ; the right of a widow to sue for a pension which her husband 's employers promised to pay her under contract with him ; ( See ' ' Dutton v Poole ' ' and cf. ' ' In re Schebsman ' ' ) ; or the right of a man 's servants and guests to claim on an insurance policy , taken out by him against loss by burglary which is expressed to cover them ; cf ' ' Prudential Staff Union v Hall ' ' . In some cases the legislature itself has intervened , as , for instance , to give the driver of a motor car the right to sue on an insurance policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver . But this does not mean that the common law would not have reached the same result by itself . The particular application of the principle with which we are concerned here is the case of covenants made with the owner of the land to which they relate . The law on this subject was fully expounded by Mr. Smith in his note to ' ' Spencer 's case ' ' which has always been regarded as authoritative . Such covenants are clearly intended , and usually expressed , to be for the benefit of whomsoever should be the owner of the land for the time being ; and at common law each successive owner has a sufficient interest to sue because he holds the same estate as the original owner . The reason which Lord Coke gave for this rule is the reason which underlies the whole of the principle now under consideration . He said in his work upon Littleton that it was to give damages to the party grieved . If a successor in title were not allowed to sue it would mean that the covenantor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that the original owner , after he has parted with the land , could recover no more than nominal damages for any breach that occurred thereafter . It was always held , however , at common law that , in order that a successor in title should be entitled to sue , he must be of the same estate as the original owner . That alone was a sufficient interest to entitle him to enforce the contract . The covenant was supposed to be made for the benefit of the owner and his successors in title , and not for the benefit of anyone else . This limitation , however , was , as is pointed out in Smith 's Leading Cases , capable of being productive of very serious and disagreeable consequences , and it has been removed by s. 78 of the Law of Property Act 1925 , which provides that a covenant relating to any land of the covenantee shall be deemed to be made with the covenantee and his successors in title , and the persons deriving title under him or them and shall have effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The covenant of the catchment board in this case clearly relates to the land of the covenantees . It was a covenant to do work on the land for the benefit of the land . By the statute , therefore , it is to be deemed to be made , not only with the original owner , but also with the purchasers of the land and their tenants as if they were expressed . Now if they were expressed , it would be clear that the covenant was made for their benefit ; and they clearly have sufficient interest to entitle them to enforce it because they have suffered the damage . The result is that the plaintiffs come within the principle whereby a person interested can sue on a contract expressly made for his benefit . I would not wish to leave this subject without referring also to s. 56 of the Law of Property Act , 1925 , which says that a person may take the benefit of any covenant or agreement respecting land or other property , although he may not be named as a party to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greene has said , confined to cases when the person seeking to take advantage of it is a person within the benefit of the covenant or agreement ; ( See ' ' White v Bijou Mansions ' ' ) ; but , subject to that limitation , there is no reason why the section should not be given its full scope , just as Lord Dunedin was prepared to give full scope to its narrower predecessor , s. 5 of the Real Property Act 1845 . ( See ' ' Dyson v Forster ' ' . ) Section 56 means , therefore , that a person may enforce an agreement respecting property made for his benefit , although he was not a party to it . So construed it is a clear statutory recognition of the principle to which I have referred and it is applicable to this case . If the principle had been canvassed in ' ' In re Miller 's Agreement ' ' , it should , I think have been held there that the daughters had a right at common law to sue for their pension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not believe that the covenantors there could break their contract with impunity . So much for the question of principle . Mr. Nield did urge that the benefit of the covenant should not run with the land here because there was no clearly defined piece of land to which it was attached . It is true that the agreement did not describe the lands by metes and bounds , but it did give a description of them which was capable of being rendered certain by extrinsic evidence ; and that is sufficient . Id certum est quod certum reddi potest . Mr. Nield also argued that there was no servient tenement . But that is only material when there is a question whether the burden of a covenant runs with the land . This is a question of the benefit running , and ever since ' ' The Prior 's case ' ' it has been held that the covenantor is liable because of his covenant given to the owner of the dominant tenement and not because of his relationship to any servient tenement . In my opinion , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for breach of covenant . It is thus unnecessary to consider whether they are liable in tort , but I will add a word about it . The decision of the House of Lords , in the ' ' East Suffolk case ' ' , shows that , in the absence of a contract , a catchment board is under no duty to exercise its powers with efficiency or dispatch or at all ; but it also shows that if it does exercise its powers it must use reasonable care not to injure persons likely to be affected by its operations . The present case is very different from that one , because here the landowners , in consequence of the works done by the board , ploughed up the land and cultivated the fields ; and in the result suffered damage which they would not have done if the board had done nothing , for in that case they would have had no crops there . The decision of the House of Lords does show , however , that , in considering whether the board broke its duty in tort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works which it is said they ought to have constructed . An adjacent landowner must not be too critical if the board prefers thrift to efficiency , I suppose on the principle that he should not look a gift horse in the mouth and must be prepared to take it with some faults . But the duty in contract is a very different thing . There is no question of a gift horse there . The landowner paid his contribution in return for the board 's promise , and they are in duty bound to fulfil it . I agree , therefore , that the appeal should be allowed .
