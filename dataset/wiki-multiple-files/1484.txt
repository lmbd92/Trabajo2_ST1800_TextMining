An epigram - widely attributed to President James A. Garfield , a student of Hopkins - defined an ideal college as Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on the other . # Life and career # Great-nephew of the theologian Samuel Hopkins , Mark Hopkins was born in Stockbridge , Massachusetts .

His volume of lectures on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delivered as a series of lectures at the Lowell Institute in January 1844 . The book became a favorite text-book in American Christian apologetics being reprinted in many editions up until 1909 . Although not trained as a lawyer Hopkins held a lifelong interest in the law and aspects of his argument in Evidences of Christianity reflects legal metaphors and language about the veracity of eyewitness testimony to the events in the life of Jesus Christ . Much of his apologetic arguments though were a restatement of views that had been previously presented by earlier apologists such as William Paley and Thomas Hartwell Horne .

At an 1871 dinner of Williams alumni , Garfield paid tribute to Hopkins , defining an ideal college as Hopkins and a student together in a log cabin . The epigram became more widely-known in the pithier form retold by John James Ingalls , in which a log was substituted for the log cabin . In the later judgment of university historian Frederick Rudolph , no one can properly address himself to the question of higher education in the United States without paying homage in some way to the aphorism of the log and to Mark Hopkins .
