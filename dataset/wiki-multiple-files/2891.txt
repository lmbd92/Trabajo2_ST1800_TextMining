@@25527514 Abraham Samuel , also known as Tolinar Rex , born in Martinique ( or possibly in Anosy , Madagascar ) , was a mulatto pirate of the Indian Ocean in the days of the Pirate Round in the late-1690s . Being shipwrecked on his way back to New York , he briefly led a combined pirate-Antanosy kingdom from Fort Dauphin ( see Tolanaro ) , Madagascar , from 1697 until he died there in 1705. # Life # One of the incidents during Samuel 's rule of the Fort Dauphin area was the following . In 1698 , early in the career of John Cruger ( the elder ) , the Mayor of New York from 1739 till his death in 1744 ) , while he was a mere youth he was appointed as Supercargo under Captain ( see Captain ( nautical ) ) Appel of the ' ' Prophet Daniel ' ' , to buy slaves for what was by then a regular slaver ( slave ship ) out of New York . It was bound for Madagascar on what would be its last voyage .

Whereupon I made all the haste down I could , when we got some of the subjects of Mr. Samuel to assist , us , and we fired upon said pirate for two days , but could do no good . Then I hired two men to swim off in the night to cut their cables , but Mr. Samuel charged them not to meddle with them , ( as I was informed , said Samuel having got a letter from on board the said pirates , in which I suppose they made great promises , so that he forbid us upon our lives not to meddle with any of said pirates ) . **6;14219;br When said ship came in at an anchor they desired our boat to give them a cast on shore , they having lost their boats , and pretended to be a merchant ship , and had about 50 negroes on board .

The Captain 's name of the pirate was Evan Jones .. and crew from Westchester , New York , and others . **6;14227;br Mr. Abraham Samuel took likewise away from me 22 casks of powder and 49 small arms , likewise all the sails belonging to the ' ' Prophet ' ' which were on shore , and then sold the ship again to Isaac Ruff , Thomas Welles , Edmd .

Captain Henry Appel .. and two others went along with them ; **6;14235;br Some days after there arrived at Fort Dolphin a small pinke , called the ' ' Vine ' ' , Thomas Warrent , master , from London , which took in slaves from said place , and bound for Barbadoes , in which I took my passage , and was forced to pay for the same 66 pieces of eight and two slaves . **6;14243;br Saturday , 18th November , 1699 , I departed from Fort Dolphin with four of the people more that belonged to the ship ' ' Prophet Daniel ' ' , in the aforesaid pinke ' ' Vine ' ' , for Barbadoes , leaving on shore , of the ship 's company , only a mulatto boy , called Gabriel ; .. 24th March , arrived at Barbadoes ; 17th April , 1700 departed from Barbadoes in the pinke ' ' Blossom , ' ' Robert Darkins , commander , bound for New York ; llth May , 1700,1 arrived at New York , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it may be thought that I have saved any thing that belongs to the owners of said ship , I do declare that I have not , directly nor indirectly , saved any thing that belongs to them , nor wronged them of the value of a farthing , but contrary , I have done all possible to serve their interest that I could . **6;14251;br JOHN CRUGER . # According to Butel et al . ( 2000 ) , at this point in time New York shipped provisions including gunpowder and guns to Madagascar , which were then traded for slaves , who were primarily prisoners of war , which were then shipped back to New York . These authors also note that Cruger had so antagonized the crew on the front end of the journey , including one New Yorker of African origins , that by the time they reached Sao Tome , the Captain indicated they would mutiny if not paid at least some of their wages . As noted above , Cruger sold some of the ship 's rigging to pay for this . For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
