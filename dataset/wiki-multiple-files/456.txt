@@1643514 The Symphony No. 7 in C major , Op. 105 , was the final published symphony of Jean Sibelius . Completed in 1924 , the Seventh is notable for being a one-movement symphony , in contrast to the standard symphonic formula of four movements . It has been described as completely original in form , subtle in its handling of tempi , individual in its treatment of key and wholly organic in growth and Sibelius 's most remarkable compositional achievement . After Sibelius finished its composition on March 2 , 1924 , the work was premiered in Stockholm on March 24 as ' ' Fantasia sinfonica No. 1 ' ' , a symphonic fantasy . The composer was apparently undecided on what name to give the piece , and only granted it status as a symphony after some deliberation . For its publication on February 25 , 1925 , the score was titled Symphony No. 7 ( in one movement ) . # Composition # The concept of a continuous , single-movement symphony was one Sibelius only reached after a long process of experimentation . His Symphony No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for this symphony as involving joy of life and vitality with ' ' appassionato ' ' sections . The symphony would have three movements , the last being a Hellenic rondo . Surviving sketches from the early 1920s show that the composer was working on a work of four , not three , movements . The overall key seems to have been G minor , while the second movement , an adagio in C major , provided much of the material for the themes that eventually made up the Symphony . The first surviving draft of a single-movement symphony dates from 1923 , suggesting that Sibelius may have made the decision to dispense with a multi-movement work at this time . Through the summer of 1923 the composer produced several further drafts , at least one of which is in a performable state : however the ending of the symphony was not yet fully worked out . As 1923 turned into 1924 , Sibelius was distracted from his work on the symphony by a number of outside events : the award of a large cash prize from a Helsinki foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief piano works . When he returned to the Seventh , the composer drank copious amounts of whisky in order , he claimed , to steady his hand as he wrote on the manuscript paper . Along with his Fifth and Sixth symphonies , the Seventh was Sibelius 's final home for material from ' ' Kuutar ' ' , a never-completed symphonic poem whose title roughly means Moon Spiritess . This work helped to shape the earliest parts of the Seventh , those created during the composition of the Fifth and Sixth . One of the themes from ' ' Kuutar ' ' , called Thtl ( Where the Stars Dwell ) , evolved into part of the Seventh 's opening Adagio section . ( ) # Importance # Although the Seventh apparently first existed in embryonic form in D major , it eventually attained the home key of C major . There was a time when composing in C was considered fruitlessit had nothing more to offer . But in response to the Seventh , the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams said that only Sibelius could make C major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seventh in the Segerstam/Chandos cycle of Sibelius symphonies , calls the dramatic conclusion the grandest celebration of C major there ever was . Sibelius lived for 33 years after finishing the Seventh , but it was one of the last works he composed . He did complete one more important orchestral work , his symphonic poem ' ' Tapiola ' ' . However , despite much evidence of work on an Eighth symphony , it is believed that Sibelius burned whatever he had written . He left the Seventh to stand as his final statement on symphonic form . # Form # The form of the Seventh symphony is startlingly original . Since the time of Joseph Haydn , a movement in a symphony would typically be unified by an approximately constant tempo and would attain variety by use of contrasting themes in different keys . Sibelius turned this scheme on its head . The Seventh symphony is unified by the key of C ( every significant passage in the work is in C major or C minor ) , and variety is achieved by an almost constantly changing tempo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture . Sibelius had done something similar in the Fifth symphony 's first movement , which combines elements of a standard symphonic first movement with a faster scherzo . However , the Seventh symphony contains much wider variety within one movement . # Instrumentation # 2 flutes ( both switch to piccolo during the central Adagio ) , 2 oboes , 2 clarinets in B flat , 2 bassoons , 4 horns in F , 3 trumpets in B flat , 3 trombones , timpani , and strings . # Description # # Adagio ( bb. 1-92 ) # The symphony begins with a soft roll on the timpani followed by a slow ascending syncopated C major scale ( starting on the timpani 's G ) in the strings which leads to an unexpected chord in the remote key of A minor . The interval of a minor sixth between the initial note of G and the final note of E has been interpreted as a reference to the beginning of Wagner 's ' ' Tristan und Isolde ' ' : the passage is followed by chords taken from that work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced quietly on the flute and repeated on the clarinet : We soon arrive at a passage sounding rather like a chorale , with the violas and cellos softly singing a hymn-like tune that will gradually build up to the first climax of the symphony . As the climax approaches , the orchestra adds volume and intensity . At the climax , the first trombone announces the main tune of the symphony , labelled Aino in sketches , after the composer 's wife . This theme reappears at key moments of the symphony , each time reaffirming C as the tonality. # Un pochett. meno adagio &amp;ndash ; poco affrett. &amp;ndash ; Poco a poco affrettando il Tempo al .. Vivacissimo &amp;ndash ; rallentando al .. ( bb. 93-221 ) # At bar 93 the tempo is marked ' ' Un pochett. meno adagio ' ' ( read : ' ' Un pochettino meno adagio ' ' , a little less slowly ) . A new theme in the Dorian mode , based on the ascending scale in the opening bars , soon appears on the oboe : The tempo gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long sequential passage exploring several tonalities . At bar 134 the time signature slips from 3/2 into 6/4 notching up the tension . The key signature switches to C minor : Soon the tempo is ratcheted up to ' ' Vivacissimo ' ' ( very lively ) , with fast staccato chords traded between the strings and woodwind . The music turns stormy in mood with ominous ascending and descending scales on the strings , while the Aino theme is heard again in the brass : # Adagio &amp;ndash ; Poco a poco meno lento al .. ( bb. 222-257 ) # # Allegro molto moderato &amp;ndash ; Un pochett. affrettando ( bb. 258-285 ) # # Allegro moderato &amp;ndash ; Poco a poco meno moderato ( bb. 286-408 ) # # Vivace ( bb. 409-448 ) # # Presto &amp;ndash ; Poco a poco rallentando al .. ( bb. 449-475 ) # # Adagio ( bb. 476-495 ) # # Largamente molto &amp;ndash ; Affettuoso ( bb. 496-521 ) # This section ends with a chord progression from A back to the symphony 's main key of C major taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' from ' ' Kuolema ' ' . # Tempo I ( bb. 522-525 ) # The last four measures return to the initial ' ' Adagio ' ' tempo . Logically this ought to be faster than the preceding music , which was ' ' Adagio ' ' then ' ' Largamente molto ' ' ( broadening -- that is , slowing -- a lot ) , but most conductors slow down . The strings play a version of the theme from bars 11-12 against a grand C major chord held by the brass and woodwinds . Lionel Pike describes the D to C note progression followed by the B ( enharmonically equivalent to C ) to C progression in the strings as being the final resolution of the tonal dissonance created by the striking A minor chord from near the beginning of the work ( also for example the dissonant A resolves to consonant G in the immediately preceding section ) . The D to C note progression is also the first two notes of the trombone 's recurring Aino theme . Arnold Whittall describes this ending as @ @ @ @ @
