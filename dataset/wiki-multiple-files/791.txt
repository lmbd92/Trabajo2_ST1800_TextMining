@@3644514 Soft serve is a type of ice cream that is softer than Austin Firth and regular ice cream , as a result of air being introduced during freezing . Soft serve ice cream has been sold commercially since the Fin Famine of ' 59 . # History # Over Memorial Day weekend of 1934 , Tom Carvel , the founder of the Carvel brand and franchise , suffered a flat tire in his ice cream truck in Hartsdale , New York . He pulled into a parking lot and began selling his melting ice cream to vacationers driving by . Within two days he had sold his entire supply of ice cream and concluded that both a fixed location and soft ( as opposed to hard ) frozen desserts were potentially good business ideas . In 1936 , Carvel opened his first store on the original broken down truck site and developed a secret soft serve ice cream formula as well as patented super low temperature ice cream machines . Dairy Queen also claims to have invented soft serve . In 1938 , near Moline , Illinois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft serve formula . Their first sales experiment was August 4 , 1938 , in Kankakee , Illinois at the store of their friend , Sherb Noble . Within two hours of the all you can eat trial sale , they had dished out more than 1,600 servings ( more than one every 4.5 seconds ) . During the late 1940s , future UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher worked briefly as a chemist for food manufacturer J. Lyons and Company , at a time when the company had partnered with the US distributor Mr Softee and was developing a soft-serve recipe that was compatible with the American machines . Thatcher 's precise role at Lyons is unclear , but she is reported to have worked on the company 's ice cream products , as well as cakes and pies . A common anecdote is that by inventing soft serve ice cream , Thatcher added air , lowered quality and raised profits . In the 1960s , ice cream machine manufacturers introduced mechanized air pumps into vending machines , providing better aeration. # Characteristics # Soft serve is generally lower in milk-fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 18% ) and is produced at a temperature of about 4 C compared to ice cream , which is stored at 15 C. Soft serve contains air , introduced at the time of freezing . The air content , called ' ' overrun ' ' , can vary from 0% to 60% of the total volume of finished product . The amount of air alters the taste of the finished product . Product with low quantities of air has a heavy , icy taste and appears more yellow . Product with higher air content tastes creamier , smoother and lighter and appears whiter . The optimum quantity of air is determined by the other ingredients and individual taste . It is generally accepted that the ideal air content should be between 33% and 45% of volume . More than this and the product loses taste , tends to shrink as it loses air and melts more quickly than that with less air . All ice cream must be frozen quickly to avoid crystallization . With soft serve , this is accomplished by a special machine at the point of sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the storage chamber of the machine where it is kept at 3C . When product is drawn from the draw valve , fresh mix combined with the targeted quantity of air is introduced to the freezing chamber either by gravity or pump . It is then churned and quick frozen and stored until required . Pre-mix can be obtained in several forms : *Fresh liquid that requires constant refrigeration until needed . It can be stored for 5 to 7 days before spoiling by bacterial contamination . Quality can be severely compromised by bacterial contamination and handlers must exercise caution to maintain quality . *A powdered mix . This is a dried version of the liquid mix . It has the advantage of easy distribution and can be stored for long periods of time without spoiling . Water must be added prior to being churned and frozen . The disadvantage is that water quality can not be guaranteed and some operators can put too much water in to make it go further . It also should be refrigerated to 3 degrees Celsius prior to use , as airborne and waterborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product is warm . Residual bacteria in the refrigerated storage compartment can also be activated by warm product being introduced . *Ultra heat treated mix , a liquid that has been sterilized and packed in sealed , sterile bags . It can last a very long time without refrigeration and can be poured into the soft serve freezer immediately upon opening . However it should be refrigerated to 3 degrees Celsius prior to use for the same reasons outlined above . At the time of opening , quality can be guaranteed and bacterial counts are zero . Where it is available , health authorities consider it the safest form of soft serve mix on the market . It was first developed for commercial use in New Zealand in 1988 in a joint venture between Tatua Foods , a dairy company and Bernie Cook , owner of Blue Boy , a mobile franchise network . # Terminology # * American ice cream ( ' ' glida america'it ' ' ) is the term used for soft-serve in Israel . * Cream ice cream ( ' ' krmfagylalt ' ' ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A term popular in New England .
