@@731514 The loop electrosurgical excision procedure ( LEEP ) is one of the most commonly used approaches to treat high grade cervical dysplasia ( CIN II/III , HGSIL ) discovered on colposcopic examination . In UK it is known as large loop excision of the transformation zone ( LLETZ ) . The procedure has many advantages including low cost , high success rate , and ease of use . The procedure can be done in an office setting and usually only requires a local anesthetic , though sometimes IV sedation or a general anesthetic is used . # Process # When performing a LEEP , the physician uses a wire loop through which an electric current is passed at variable power settings . Various shapes and sizes of loop can be used depending on the size and orientation of the lesion . The cervical transformation zone and lesion are excised to an adequate depth , which in most cases is at least 8 mm , and extending 4 to 5 mm beyond the lesion . A second pass with a more narrow loop can also be done to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique results in some thermal artifact in all specimens obtained due to the use of electricity which simultaneously cuts and cauterizes the lesion , but this does not generally interfere with pathological interpretation . # Complications # Complications are less frequent in comparison to a cold knife conization , but can include infection and hemorrhage . A study with surveys to women has indicated that the LEEP does not appear to affect fertility . On the other hand , a case-control study has found an association between surgical treatment of CIN lesions and risk of infertility or subfertility , with an odds ratio of approximately 2 . Scarring of the cervix is a theoretical mechanism of causing trouble conceiving . This scar tissue can be massaged or broken up in a number of ways , thus allowing the cervical opening to dilate back to normal size . A cohort study came to the result that women with a time interval from LEEP to pregnancy of less than 12 months compared with 12 months or more were at significantly increased risk for spontaneous abortion , with risk of spontaneous abortion of 18% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no increased risk was identified for preterm birth after LEEP.
