@@4675514 ' ' Cymbospondylus ' ' ( A Greek word meaning ' ' Boat Spine ' ' ) was a basal early ichthyosaur that lived between the middle and later years of the Triassic period ( 240-210 million years ago ) . Previously , the genus was classified as a shastasaurid , however , more recent work finds it to be more basal . # Discovery # Fossils have been found in both Germany and Nevada , and the first species was named by Joseph Leidy in 1868 . It was not until the early 1900s that the first complete skeletons were discovered . Fossil vertebrae from ' ' Cymbospondylus ' ' were allegedly used as plates by Nevada 's silver miners ; it is now the state 's official fossil . # Palaeobiology # ' ' Cymbospondylus ' ' was one of the largest ichthyosaurs , with fossils ranging from 6to10 m long . It was also one of the least fish-like of the ichthyosaurs , lacking a dorsal fin and fluked tail . It did , however , have an elongated snout like other ichthyosaurs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with large jaws , contained rows of teeth adapted for catching and holding on to fish , belemnites , and cephalopods such as ammonites . The long tail would have been excellent for swimming , and allowed ' ' Cymbospondylus ' ' to move at fast speeds and efficiently hunt down shoals of swimming fish . Adult ' ' Cymbospondylus ' ' probably spent much of their time hunting in deep offshore water , only venturing into shallower water to breed or to catch seasonally available prey . Like other ichthyosaurs , ' ' Cymbospondylus ' ' probably gave birth to live young , as it had no way to lay eggs . These , on reaching adult size , probably had few , if any , predators that could harm them . The eel-like tail of ' ' Cymbospondylus ' ' made up almost half the total body length , and it is possible that the tail was used as a primary swimming mechanism . Like present day sea snakes , ' ' Cymbospondylus ' ' probably swam by wriggling its body from side to side .

' ' Shastasaurus ' ' is the largest known .
