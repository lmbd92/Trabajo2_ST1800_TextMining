@@14724514 Epipubic bones are a pair of bones projecting forward from the pelvic bones of modern marsupials and of some fossil mammals : multituberculates , monotremes , and even basal eutherians ( the ancestors of placental mammals ) . In modern marsupials the epipubic bones are often called marsupial bones because they support the mother 's pouch ( ' ' marsupium ' ' is Latin for pouch ) , but their presence on other groups of mammals indicates that this was not their original function , which some researchers think was to assist locomotion by supporting some of the muscles that flex the thigh . The epipubic bones were first described in 1698 but their functions have remained unresolved . It has been suggested that they form part of a kinetic linkage stretching from the femur on one side to the ribs on the opposite side . This linkage is formed by a series of muscles : each epipubic bone is connected to the femur by the pectineus muscle , and to the ribs and vertebrae by the pyramidalis , rectus abdominis , and external and internal obliques . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levers to stiffen the trunk during locomotion. # See also # * Evolution of mammals * Obturator process * Proximodorsal process
