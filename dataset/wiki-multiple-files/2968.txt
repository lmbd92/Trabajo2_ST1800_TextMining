@@26378514 A funeral procession in the Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines encompass a wide range of personal , cultural , and traditional beliefs and practices which Filipinos observe in relation to death , bereavement , and the proper honoring , interment , and remembrance of the dead . These practises have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the Philippines throughout its complex history . Most if not all present-day Filipinos , like their ancestors , believe in some form of an afterlife and give considerable attention to honouring the dead . Except amongst Filipino Muslims ( who are obliged to bury a corpse less than 24 hours after death ) , a wake is generally held from three days to a week . Wakes in rural areas are usually held in the home , while in urban settings the dead is typically displayed in a funeral home . Apart from spreading the news about someones death verbally , obituaries are also published in newspapers . Although the majority of the Filipino people are Christians , they have retained some traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # # Wake # When a person dies in the Philippines , Filipino Catholic people , such as the Tagalogs , generally hold a wake known as ' ' lamay ' ' or ' ' paglalamay ' ' , a vigil that typically lasts for five to seven nights , but may last longer if the bereaved are waiting for a relation travelling from afar . During this time , the cleaned and embalmed corpse is placed in a coffin , and displayed at the house of deceased or at a funeral home . The casket is traditionally surrounded by funeral lights , a guest registry book , a contribution box , and flowers . Family members , relatives , and acquaintances participate in the vigil . Apart from offering condolences , mourners and visitors provide financial donations ( called ' ' abuloy ' ' ) to help defray the funeral and burial costs . Food and warm drinks are customarily served by the bereaved during the night vigil , and typical activities conducted outside or near the vigil area include engaging in conversation , singing , guitar playing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is normal that concerned visitors ask the bereaved questions that other cultures deem too sensitive , such as how the decedent died , if he or she suffered , or the cost of hospitalisation or treatment . Such personal questions convey valid affection and concern from guests . Other people also customarily offer masses , novenas , and prayers for the benefit of the deceased . On the funeral day , the coffin is generally loaded into a hearse or borne by family members , relatives , or friends in procession towards the church and later the cemetery . Other mourners follow the hearse during the funeral march . Catholic funerals involve the celebration of the Mass , while Protestant funerals include singing of hymns and recitation of prayers by a minister . The traditional colour worn at memorial services and interments is black , save for the Chinese-Filipino that customarily don white . If white clothing is worn , it is customary to sport a black mourning pin on the breast . Some funerals have men wear the Barong Tagalog and black trousers while sporting a black armband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being formal wear , it is considered appropriate . Women are meanwhile dressed in either black or white , with ladies in more traditional areas also wearing veils and headbands that match their dress . After the entombment , the bereaved offer prayers such as the rosary for the dead every evening for nine days , a custom called the ' ' pasiyam ' ' or ' ' pagsisiyam ' ' ( literally , to do for nine days ) . This novena often concludes with a service followed by formal meal with family and friends . The custom is base on the folk belief that the soul of the departed enters the afterlife on the ninth day . This is followed by a special prayer service or Mass on the fortieth day , evoking the forty days between Christ 's Resurrection and Ascension . The bereavement period extends for a period of one year when another service is held on the first death anniversary , called the ' ' babang luks ' ' ( lit. , descent from mourning ) . # All Souls Day # Catholic and Aglipayan Filipinos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and All Souls ' Day . People gather in graveyards to clean and decorate the family grave as early as All Hallow 's Eve , then offer the dead prayers , candles , flowers and sometimes food .

This is to prevent the deceased 's spirit from loitering and bringing misfortune to the household ; to some Filipinos , a casket hitting any object during a funeral means that another person will die soon . After the burial service , family members wash their hair with a shampoo called ' ' gugu ' ' to remove the influence of the deceased 's spirit .

These ancient potteries were found in the Manunggul Cave on the island of Palawan . A characteristic of the jars for the dead is the presence of anthropomorphic human figures on the pot covers . These figures embody souls riding a boat for the dead while seafaring towards their sanctuary in the afterlife . These containers have been dated from 710 BC to 890 BC . There are also figures of boating people steering paddles , wearing headbands , jaw-bands , and persons with hands folded across the chest area . The latter is a method of arranging the remains of the dead . Other similar anthropomorphic jars were also found at Pinol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saranggani Province of the island of Mindanao .

Cebuanos also have superstitious beliefs related to funerals that include : placing funeral alms or ' ' limos ' ' into a container , refraining from sweeping the floor of the deceased 's home ( wastes are collected by hand instead of being swept by brooms ; other Filipinos also have this superstition ) , no bathing and no combing of hair on the part of relatives ( other Filipinos too believe in this ) , placing worn mourning pins into the coffin during interment , preventing tears from dropping onto the glass plate of the casket ( in order for the departed soul to travel in peace ) , placing a chick on top of the coffin of an individual who died due to a transgression ( to hasten justice for the dead victim ) , wearing black or white clothes during the interment ( except for a child who is dressed with a red-colored garment , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , urging relatives to pass through under the casket before it is loaded onto the funeral vehicle ( to assist the surviving relatives in moving on with their life ) , marching the dead towards the church and the cemetery ( known as the ' ' hatod ' ' , or carrying the departed to his destination on foot ) , consuming food only at the cemetery after the interment , and passing through smoke while still within the cemetery or by the gates of the cemetery ( to untangle the spirits of the dead from the bodies of the living ) . # #Ilonggo# # Merriment , singing , and poem recitations are components of funerals in Oton , Iloilo .

Examples are : the appearance of a lingering black butterfly around an individual is an omen that a person 's next of kin has died ; a sick person heading toward hospital who sees a black-hued cat will not survive their condition ; seeing an owl near the home of a sick individual signifies the infirm 's imminent death .
