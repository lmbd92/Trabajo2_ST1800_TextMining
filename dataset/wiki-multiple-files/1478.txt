@@9753514 According to Christian tradition , Saint Amaro or Amarus the Pilgrim ( ) was an abbot and sailor who it was claimed sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to an earthly paradise . There are two historical figures who may have provided the basis for this legend . The first was a French penitent of the same name who went on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in the thirteenth century . On his return journey , he established himself at Burgos , where he founded a hospital for lepers . Saint Amaro has also been identified with Saint Maurus , disciple of Saint Benedict , who founded the first Benedictine monastery in France . Around the historical character of Saint Amaro converged many Pagan traditions present in Asturias and Galicia related with Celtic ' ' immrama ' ' and ' ' echtrai ' ' like the voyages of Mael Din , the i Chorra , Snegdus and Mac Riagla or Bran mac Febal . Many features of the Celtic Otherworld are present in the Periplus of Saint Amaro. # The Periplus of Amaro # Like Saint Brendan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoes that of the Irish ' ' immram ' ' the voyages to the paradisiacal islands of the West . An edition of the ' ' Life of Saint Amaro ' ' was published at Burgos in 1552 . His legend holds that Amaro was a noble Christian from Asia who was obsessed with the idea of visiting the earthly paradise . With this goal in mind , he would inquire for more information from his guests . Amaro was not successful in receiving information from them and was quite desperate and anguished about this until one night , God appeared to him and revealed how to reach his objective . Amaro would have to build a boat and follow the path of the sun across the Atlantic Ocean . Amaro took to the sea with some companions and sailed for six days and seven nights until he reached an island . This was an extremely fertile land that was blessed with five cities inhabited by uncouth men though the women were quite beautiful . Amaro spent six months there until he heard a voice in his dreams telling him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he reached the land of a beautiful fountain , where the people were beautiful and lived peaceful lives that lasted three hundred years . Amaro remained there for three weeks until an old woman advised that he leave the island before he became accustomed to the good life . Three days later they arrived at another desert island , which was inhabited by savage beasts hostile to man . There they found a hermit who informed them that the beasts there annihilated themselves by fighting one another on the day of Saint John ; the stench of the corpses persisted throughout the year . The hermit provided them with supplies and recommended that they sail East , where there was a beautiful land that would satisfy all of their needs . They sailed the next day and arrived in the afternoon , finding a monastery named Valdeflores . A monk from this monastery , Leonites , greeted them and told Amaro that he was waiting for him : he was already informed of their arrival by means of a vision . Leonites provided Amaro with instructions on how to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions arrived at a natural harbor where they remained for a month , after which they traveled to an extensive and rugged valley , where Amaro will find what he was looking for : the Earthly Paradise . First , however , Amaro stumbled upon a nunnery situated high upon a mountaintop called ' ' Flor de Dueas ' ' ( Flower of Ladies ) . He remained there , receiving further instructions on how to reach Paradise from a holy woman named Baralides . He is presented with a white habit . This is given to him by Brgida ( Bridget ) , the niece of Baralides who lives in Paradise . Unfortunately , Leonites began to cry : he 's losing a dear friend . But Baralides appears , and comforts Leonites with a gift . She presents him with a branch of one of the two magical trees of the Earthly Paradise . # Amaro in Paradise # In Paradise , Amaro found an enormous castle built from gems and precious metals , with battlements of gold and towers of rubies , walls made with multicolored bricks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earthly Paradise , and thus no living being can enter it . The saint begged the gatekeeper to allow him to look at Paradise through the keyhole . Amaro was allowed to do this , and saw many things , including the Tree of life from which Adam ate ; a primeval and eternal garden ; enormous trees ; birds whose song was so beautiful one could remain entranced by it for a thousand years ; young musicians playing strange and unknown musical instruments ; beautiful ladies adorned with a crown of flowers and dressed in white ; the Virgin Mary , who accompanied these young ladies . Saint Amaro begged to be allowed in ; the gatekeeper refused and informed him that during the saint 's viewing of Paradise , three hundred years have passed . Amaro returned to the coast to find his companions gone and a city named after him built there . Amaro told the citys inhabitants his story and they built him a house alongside the monastery of Valdeflores , where he lived for a number of years until he died . He was buried alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hermitages dedicated to Amaro in Spain . There is a hermitage dedicated to Amaro in Puerto de la Cruz , Tenerife ( ' ' Ermita de San Amaro ' ' ) . The town of San Amaro in Ourense province is named after him . His cult was also diffused in Portugal , where he is called ' ' Santo Amaro ' ' . In the districts of Coimbra and Viseu , Saint Amaro is brought pinecones , nuts , and dry figs as an ex-voto offering but he only accepts these items if they have been stolen . Saint Matthew , Saint Simon , and Saint Bartholomew are also brought things that have been stolen . He is also venerated with an annual religious festival in the parish of Ponta Delgada . At Beja , the whitewashed church of Santo Amaro is one of just four pre-Romanesque churches left in Portugal . Some parts date from the sixth century and the interior columns and capitals are carved with foliages and geometric designs from the seventh century . # References # * *
