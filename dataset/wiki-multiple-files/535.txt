@@2036514 Infobox Aircraft Begin Infobox Aircraft Type The Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior , more commonly known as the Lockheed 12 or L-12 , is an eight-seat , six-passenger all-metal twin-engine transport aircraft of the late 1930s designed for use by small airlines , companies , and wealthy private individuals . A scaled-down version of the Lockheed Model 10 Electra , the Lockheed 12 was not popular as an airliner but was widely used as a corporate and government transport . Several were also used for testing new aviation technologies . # Design and development # After Lockheed had introduced its 10-passenger Model 10 Electra , the company decided to develop a smaller version which would be better suited as a feeder airliner or a corporate executive transport . At the same time , the U.S. Bureau of Air Commerce had also sensed the need for a small feeder airliner and announced a design competition for one . In order for a candidate to qualify for the competition , a prototype had to fly by June 30 , 1936 . Lockheed based its candidate , which it named the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of the Electra airframe . It would carry only six passengers and two pilots but would use the same 450 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior SB radial engines as the main Electra version , the 10A . This made it faster than the Electra , with a top speed of 225 mph at 5000 ft . Like the Electra , the Model 12 had an all-metal structure , trailing-edge wing flaps , low-drag NACA engine cowlings , and two-bladed controllable-pitch propellers ( later changed to constant-speed propellers ) . It also had the Electra 's twin tail fins and rudders , which were becoming a Lockheed trademark . The landing gear was a conventional tail-dragger arrangement , with the main wheels retracting backwards into the engine nacelles ; as was often the case with retractable gear of the period , the wheel bottoms were left exposed in case a wheels-up emergency landing was necessary . As in the Electra and the Boeing 247 , the Model 12 's main wing spar passed through the passenger cabin ; small steps were placed on either side of the spar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear . Although the standard cabin layout was for six passengers , Lockheed also offered roomier , more luxurious layouts for corporate or private owners . The new transport had its first flight on June 27 , 1936 , three days before the competition deadline , at 12:12 PM local time , a time deliberately chosen for the Model 12 's number . As it turned out , the other two competition entries , the Beechcraft Model 18 and the Barkley-Grow T8P-1 , were n't ready in time for the deadline , so Lockheed won by default . The Electra Junior name did not catch on in the way that the original Electra 's name had . Most users simply referred to the aircraft by its model number , as the Lockheed 12 . The original Lockheed 12 version , with Wasp Junior engines , was the Model 12A . Almost every Lockheed 12 built was a 12A or derived from the 12A . There was also a Model 12B , using 440 hp Wright R-975-E3 Whirlwind radials , but only two of this model were built . Although Lockheed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R-760 Whirlwind seven-cylinder radials , and a Model 12M , powered by 290 hp Menasco six-cylinder inline engines , neither of these versions reached production . # Operational history # Even though the Lockheed 12 had won the government 's feeder airliner competition , the airlines mostly rejected it , and very few Lockheed 12s were used as airliners . One notable airline user was the newly renamed Continental Air Lines , which had a fleet of three Lockheed 12s that ran on its route between Denver , Colorado and El Paso , Texas in the late 1930s . Another was British West Indian Airways Ltd. , which flew the Lockheed 12 on Caribbean routes in the Lesser Antilles during the mid-1940s . The Lockheed 12 proved much more popular as a transport for company executives or government officials . Oil and steel companies were among the major users . A number were purchased as military staff transports by the United States Army Air Corps , which designated the type as the C-40 , and by the United States Navy , which used the designation JO , or in one peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , many civilian Lockheed 12s were requisitioned by the U.S. Army and Navy , Britain 's Royal Air Force , and the Royal Canadian Air Force . Two civil Lockheed 12s ordered by British Airways Ltd. were actually intended for covert military espionage . Sidney Cotton modified these aircraft for aerial photography and , while pretending to conduct ordinary civil flights , used them to overfly and photograph many German and Italian military installations during the months preceding World War II . The greatest military user of the Lockheed 12 was the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force , which bought 36 . Sixteen of these were the Model 212 , a specialized version created by Lockheed for training bomber crews , which had a .303-caliber machine gun in an unpowered , partly retractable gun turret on top of the fuselage , a second .303-caliber machine gun fixed in the nose , and bomb racks under the wing center section that could hold eight 100 lb bombs . The other 20 aircraft were transport versions based on the Model 212 . Several Lockheed 12s were used as technology testbeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) bought two , adding a center vertical fin to each of them to improve their stability . One of the NACA Lockheed 12s was used to test hotwing deicing technology , in which hot exhaust air from the engines was ducted through the wing 's leading edge to prevent ice accumulation . Three other Lockheed 12s were used to test tricycle landing gear . These had their normal landing gear replaced by a non-retracting version with a large nosewheel and with the main wheels shifted further back on the engine nacelles . ( The tailwheel from the normal conventional gear was retained . ) The gear was non-retractable because there was n't room within the structure to stow it in retracted position . Streamlined fairings were placed on the gear to reduce drag.One of the tricycle gear Lockheed 12s went to the U.S. Navy as the XJO-3 and performed carrier landing tests on the to study the suitability of a twin-engined tricycle-gear aircraft for carrier operations . Another went to the U.S. Army as the C-40B , and still another was retained by Lockheed for its own testing ; both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear configuration . Aviator Milo Burcham flew a Lockheed 12A in the 1937 Bendix Trophy Race from Burbank , California to Cleveland , Ohio.This 12A had been modified with extra fuel tanks in the cabin , allowing it to save time by making the entire 2043 mi trip non-stop . The 12A came in fifth at an average speed of 184 mph ; this was an impressive performance , since the first and fourth-place winners were both privately owned Seversky P-35 fighters . Another Lockheed 12A , owned by Republic Oil Company and named ' ' The Texan ' ' , was modified by aviator Jimmie Mattern for a round-the-world flight attempt.Mattern filled the 12A 's cabin with fuel tanks and removed the cabin windows and door ; the crew would enter the aircraft via a cockpit hatch . The aircraft was denied a U.S. permit for the flight following the Earhart incident , however it was pressed into action September 1937 in a long range search effort for Sigizmund Levanevsky who crashed somewhere between the North pole and Barrow , Alaska . The Texan was outfitted as a luxury transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1938 . Lockheed built a total of 130 Lockheed 12s , ending production in 1941 . With the arrival of World War II , Lockheed concentrated its production efforts on more advanced military aircraft , like the Hudson bomber and the P-38 Lightning twin-engined fighter . The Lockheed 12 's market was left to the Beechcraft Model 18 , thousands of which would eventually be produced . A number of Lockheed 12s have survived to the present day , mostly in private hands .
