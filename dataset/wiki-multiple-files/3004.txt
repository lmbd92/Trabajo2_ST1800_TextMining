From its inception in 1967 through the 2006 event , the World Lacrosse Championships were sanctioned by the International Lacrosse Federation ( ILF ) . In 2008 , the ILF merged with the former governing body for women 's lacrosse , the International Federation of Women 's Lacrosse Associations ( IFWLA ) , to form the Federation of International Lacrosse ( FIL ) .

The team sought to travel on their Haudenosaunee passports , but the British government demanded evidence that the United States would allow the Iroquois to travel and return . Even after the United States Department of State gave the team a one-time waiver , the British government denied entry to the team , saying the Iroquois passports were unacceptable . As a result , the Iroquois would have had to forfeit their opening match against England , with the host team playing Germany in an exhibition match instead . However , FIL decided to move Germany to the Blue Division and the Iroquois to the Plum Division , making the England-Germany match an official one . The Iroquois team did not officially withdraw from the tournament , and would have been allowed to play its remaining games should it have resolved its passport difficulties .
