@@7006514 precededby = ' ' The Barkleys ' ' is an American animated television series that ran from 1972 to 1973 on NBC and was produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises . # Story # The cartoon was inspired by CBS 's hit sitcom ' ' All in the Family ' ' , and to a lesser extent The Honeymooners ; it lasted only one season . The series featured a dog family consisting of Arnie , a bus driver ( voiced by Henry Corden ) and his wife Agnes ( voiced by Joan Gerber ) . They had two teenagers , Terry and Roger ( voiced by Julie McWhirter and Gene Andrusco respectively ) and one younger child , Chester ( voiced by Steve Lewis ) . The theme song 's lyrics ended with the advice Just remember Arnie Barkley 's bark is worse than his bite . This meant that Arnie 's grouchy , unsociable front concealed a softer heart which he rarely allowed to show . # Data # The series was broadcast by NBC from September 9 to December 2 , 1972 .
