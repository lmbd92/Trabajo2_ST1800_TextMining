@@25710514 Elden Pueblo was a prehistoric Native American village located at the foot of Mount Elden near Flagstaff , Arizona . The Pueblo is thought to have been part of a major trading system . Various trade items such as macaw skeletons from Mexico as well as shell jewelry from the coast of California have been found throughout the site . The area is now protected and is used for research and educational purposes . # History # The area was settled by the Sinagua peoples from approximately AD.1070 to 1275 . It is believed that the site was home to 200-300 people within 60-70 rooms . Aside from the structures constructed of compacted stones , a burial mound was discovered near the site . Two individual burials were found under the site . The site was discovered by Harold Colton and originally named it Sheep Hill Pueblo . When Jesse Walter Fewkes excavated it in 1926 and shipped all of the recovered skeletons and pots to the Smithsonian , it created a controversy with Arizona 's archeologists including Colton and Byron Cummings of the University of Arizona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various outraged Arizona newspapers . The controversy was part of the impetus for the 1927 Arizona Antiquities Act and the creation of the Northern Arizona Society of Science and Art . There is some controversy about the burial mound ; some say the mound is simply a dirt pile from the nearby Fewkes ' excavation . Ruins from another structure were also found underneath the mound which also leads to questions its authenticity . Archeological studies have uncovered information regarding architectural design and the social hierarchy of the Sinagua people . Social hierarchy can be deduced from the variations in burial techniques as well as the decorative features of the grave . Although it has been stated that the Winona meteorite was found at Elden Pueblo , it was in fact found at another Sinagua site miles away .
