@@4823514 The United Freedom Front ( UFF ) was a small American Marxist organization active in the 1970s and 1980s . It was originally called the Sam Melville/Jonathan Jackson Unit , and its members became known as the Ohio 7 when they were brought to trial . Between 1975 and 1984 the UFF carried out at least 20 bombings and nine bank robberies in the northeastern United States , targeting corporate buildings , courthouses , and military facilities . Brent L. Smith describes them as undoubtedly the most successful of the leftist terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s . The group 's members were eventually apprehended and convicted of conspiracy , murder , attempted murder , and other charges . Two , Tom Manning and Jaan Laaman , remain incarcerated today . # Activities # The group was founded in 1975 as the Sam Melville/Jonathan Jackson Unit , setting off a bomb at the Massachusetts State House under that name , but changed its name to the United Freedom Front the same year .

The four had worked together in prison reform groups before forming the UFF . Four other members joined the group in the following years : Jaan Laaman and Barbara Curzi ( another married couple ) , Kazi Toure ( born Christopher King ) , and Richard Williams . The UFF strongly opposed US foreign policy in Central America , as well as South African apartheid . The UFF 's targets included South African Airways , Union Carbide , IBM , Mobil , courthouses , and military facilities . The UFF called in warnings before all of its bombings , attempting to avoid casualties . However , 22 people were injured in one 1976 bombing at the Suffolk County Courthouse in Boston , including a courthouse worker who lost a leg . The group was most active in the early 1980s . The UFF 's members lived undercover in middle-class suburbs . Toure was captured in North Attleboro , Massachusetts in 1982 . Two state troopers were wounded in the course of arresting him .

Gus notes that the UFF was the most enduring of all New Left terrorist groups of the era , evading capture for almost a decade . # Trials and imprisonment # The UFF 's members were tried repeatedly on various federal and state charges . In March 1986 , seven of them ( the so-called Ohio Seven ) were convicted of conspiracy , receiving sentences ranging from 15 to 53 years . In 1987 all eight members were charged with sedition and racketeering . Eventually five accepted plea bargains , had charges against them dropped , or were tried separately , and the trial of the remaining three ended in 1989 with an acquittal for sedition and a locked jury on the racketeering charges . Thomas Manning and Richard Williams were given life sentences for the 1981 murder of state trooper Philip Lamonaco , and Laaman was convicted in the 1982 attempted murder of two state troopers .
