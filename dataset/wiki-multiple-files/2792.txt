@@24524514 Aristotle 's views on women influenced later Western thinkers , who quoted him as an authority until the end of the Middle Ages , and are thus an important topic in women 's history . He saw women subject to men , but higher than slaves . In Chapter 12 of his Politics he writes , The slave is wholly lacking the deliberative element ; the female has it but it lacks authority ; the child has it but it is incomplete ( 1260a11 ) # Differences between male and female # Aristotle believed that nature ordained not only physical differences between male and female but mental differences as well . By comparison to man , he argued , woman is more mischievous , less simple , more impulsive .. more compassionate , .. more easily moved to tears , .. more jealous , more querulous , more apt to scold and to strike , .. more prone to despondency and less hopeful , .. more void of shame or self-respect , more false of speech , more deceptive , of more retentive memory and .. also more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action ( History of Animals , 608b. 1-14 ) . Moreover , in accord with his society 's custom of allowing girls and women to eat only half as much as boys and men , he added that woman requires a smaller quantity of nutriment ( History of Animals , 608b. 14 ) Aristotle wrote extensively on his views of the nature of semen . His views on how a child 's sex is decided have since been abandoned . He wrote that only fair-skinned women , not darker-skinned women , had a sexual discharge and climaxed . He also believed this discharge could be increased by eating of pungent foods . Aristotle thought a woman 's sexual discharge was akin to that of an infertile or amputated male 's . He concluded that both sexes contributed to the material of generation , but that the female 's contribution was in her discharge ( as in a male 's ) rather than within the ovary . His idea of procreation was an active , ensouling masculine element bringing life to a passive female element . Aristotle explains how and why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by commenting on male rule over barbarians , or non-Greeks . By nature the female has been distinguished from the slave . For nature makes nothing in the manner that the coppersmiths make the Delphic knife-that is , frugally- but , rather , it makes each thing for one purpose . For each thing would do its work most nobly if it had one task rather than many . Among the barbarians the female and the slave have the same status . This is because there are no natural rulers among them but , rather , the association among them is between male and female slave . On account of this , the poets say that it is fitting that Greeks rule barbarians , as the barbarian and the slave are by nature the same . While Aristotle reduced women 's roles in society , and promoted the idea that women should receive less food and nourishment than males , he also criticised the results : a woman , he thought , was then more compassionate , more opinionated , more apt to scold and to strike . He stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame or self-respect , more false of speech , more deceptive , and of having a better memory . # Modes of Rule # Aristotle supported the laws that meant a woman 's personal wealth automatically became her husband 's . According to Aristotle , there were different ways or modes ( ' ' tropoi ' ' ) of rule , including despotic , royal , and political rule . Political rule is of those who are free and equal , who tend in their nature to be on equal terms and to differ in nothing . And Aristotle thought that a husband and wife should live under political rule , the rule suitable to those who are free and equal . Aristotle nevertheless thought that women should not leave the female quarters of the house , and by his death the health of women in Athens had deteriorated , and they were living on average 10 years less than males with elevated rates of death through child-birth . As for the differences between husband and wife , Aristotle says that these always consisted in external appearances , in speeches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband lose money and his reputation , a wife was to refrain from complaint and to attribute this to sickness , ignorance or accidental errors . He thought that , sometimes but not always , males were leaders , or , both the male and the female have the deliberative capacity of the soul , but he thought that in the female it lacked authority . # On a Good Wife , from ' ' Oikonomikos ' ' , c. 330 BCE # Therefore it befits not a man of sound mind to bestow his person promiscuously , or have random intercourse with women ; for otherwise the base-born will share in the rights of his lawful children , and his wife will be robbed of her honor due , and shame be attached to his sons.And it is fitting that he should approach his wife in honor , full of self-restraint and awe ; and in his conversation with her , should use only the words of a right-minded man , suggesting only such acts as are themselves lawful and honorable . Aristotle 's thought that a wife was best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and that he had no preference for another woman ; but before all others loves , trusts her and holds her as his own . Aristotle wrote that a husband should secure the agreement , loyalty , and devotion of his wife , so that whether he himself is present or not , there may be no difference in her attitude towards him , since she realizes that they are alike guardians of the common interests ; and so when he is away she may feel that to her no man is kinder or more virtuous or more truly hers than her own husband . # Spartan women # Aristotle wrote that in Sparta , the legislator wanted to make the whole city ( or country ) hardy and temperate , and that he carried out his intention in the case of the men , but he overlooked the women , who lived in every sort of intemperance and wealth . He added that in those regimes in which the condition of the women was bad , half the city could be regarded as having no laws . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal weight to women 's happiness as he did to men 's , and commented in his ' ' Rhetoric ' ' that a society can not be happy unless women are happy too . In an article titled ' ' Aristotle 's Account of the subjection of Women ' ' Stauffer explains that Aristotle believed that in nature a common good came of the rule of a superior being . But he does n't indicate a common good for men being superior to women . He uses the word ' Kreitton ' to indicate superiority , meaning stronger . Aristotle believed that rational reasoning is what made you superior over lesser beings in nature , yet still used the term meaning stronger , not more rational or intelligent . Would this then imply that men simply gained their superiority over women by being stronger ? # Children # On children , he said , And what could be more divine than this , or more desired by a man of sound mind , than to beget by a noble and honored wife children who shall be the most loyal supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the preservers of the whole house ? Rightly reared by father and mother , children will grow up virtuous , as those who have treated them piously and righteously deserve that they should . Aristotle believed we all have a biological drive to procreate , to leave behind something to take the place and be similar to ourselves . This then justifies the natural partnership between man and woman . And each person has one specific purpose because we are better at mastering one specific trait rather than being adequate at multiple . Women 's purpose , it seems he believes , is to birth children . Aristotle stressed that man and woman work together to raise the children and that how they raise them has a huge influence over the kind of people they become and thus the kind of society or community that everyone lives in. # Legacy # # Galen # Aristotle 's assumptions on female coldness influenced Galen and others for almost two thousand years until the sixteenth century . # Church Fathers # Joyce E.
