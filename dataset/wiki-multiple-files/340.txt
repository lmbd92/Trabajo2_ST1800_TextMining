@@1042514 ' ' Meriones unguiculatus ' ' , the Mongolian jird or Mongolian gerbil is a rodent belonging to subfamily Gerbillinae . It is the most widely known species of the gerbil subfamily , and is the usual gerbil species to be kept as a pet or experimental animal , when it is known as the domesticated gerbil . Like the Syrian or golden hamster , it was first brought to the United States in 1954 by Dr. Victor Schwentker for use in research . Forty-four pairs caught originally from Mongolia and brought to England . They were described as squirrel colors .. with long furry tails . The Mongolian gerbil is classed as a prohibited new organism under New Zealand 's Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 , preventing it from being imported into the country . # Origin # ' ' Meriones unguiculatus ' ' evolved on the semideserts and steppes of Mongolia . There , they developed long legs for jumping and running from predators , teeth to deal with hard seeds and plant matter , and water conservation techniques that allow them to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use dry food or stores of fat to generate metabolic water . Mongolian gerbils do not have many natural enemies due to the harsh climate . Most predators are birds of prey or snakes . Mongolian gerbils are diurnal , but return to their burrows for the coldest and hottest parts of the day . # Habitat # The species ' ' M. unguiculatus ' ' came originally from Mongolia . Its habitat there is mainly semideserts and steppes . Soil on the steppes is sandy and is covered with grasses , herbs , and shrubs . The steppes have cool , dry winters and hot summers . The temperature can get up to 50 C , but the average temperature for most of the year is around 20 C. In the wild , these gerbils live in groups generally consisting of one parental pair , the most recent litter , and a few older pups . Only the dominant female will produce pups , but she will mate with multiple males while in estrus ( heat ) . One group of gerbils generally ranges over 325-1550m2 acre . A group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper burrows with only one to three exits in their territory may exist . These deeper burrows are used to escape from predators when they are too far from the central burrow . A group 's burrows often interconnect with other groups . # History # The first known mention of gerbils came in 1866 , by Father Armand David , who sent yellow rats to the Museum of Natural History ( ' ' Muse d'Histoire Naturelle ' ' ) in Paris , from northern China . They were named ' ' Meriones unguiculatus ' ' by the scientist Milne-Edwards in 1867 . This scientific name in a combination of Greek and modified Latin loosely translates as clawed warrior in English , partly stemming from the Greek warrior Meriones in Homer 's ' ' Iliad ' ' , combined with ' unguiculate ' meaning to have claws or nails . Gerbils only became popular pets after 1954 , when 20 breeding pairs were brought to the United States from eastern Mongolia for scientific testing . Almost all pet gerbils today are descended from these 40 .

It was first brought from China to Paris , France in the 19th century , and became a popular house pet . It was then brought to the United States in 1954 by Dr. Victor Schwentker for use in research . Selective breeding for the pet trade has resulted in a wide range of different color and pattern varieties . # Major Colors # align=right * Golden Agouti All Mongolian Gerbils in the wild are Golden Agouti , also called Agouti .

A schimmel with ruby eyes is a Ruby Eyed Schimmel. * Black Eyed White A Black Eyed White gerbil is completely white with black eyes . Some have greyish ear tips and dark claws . * Spotting - Dominant spotting can be in any coat variety and will lighten the fur around it . How the spotting will look depends on modifiers. * Collared - A thick , unbroken band of spotting around the neck connecting to the white belly . * Collar and blaze - A thick , unbroken band of spotting around the neck connecting to the white belly and an unbroken white blaze connecting the three spotting areas ( neck , forehead and nose ) . * Pied - The base coat color may be of any standard type except for white . There is a thick band of white around the neck and shoulder area to form a collar that is connected to a blazed down the forehead and face . The distinguishing feature are small spots on the rump and back area around the spinal area . These spots usually do not have clear edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a mottled gerbil as long as the spotting pattern conforms to the standard , accepted pattern . * Mottled - The coat color of the gerbil may be any standard coat color broken by small white patches accompanying a collar and blaze . The gerbil may be up to 75% white until it would be considered a variegated gerbil. * Variegated - The variegated pattern is when any standard coat color is broken up by small white patches along with a collar and blaze . The difference between the variegated spotting form and the mottled spotting form is the amount of white . The variegated spotting is an extended form of mottling . There is more white on the back and rump , allowing less color to show through . This can form a ' dalmatian ' pattern . Often the tail tuft and the end of the tail is white or lacking pigment . * Extreme White - The extreme white pattern is associated with any standard color except for white . Here the coat color is 90% white and barely any of the base coat color , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns circulating about extreme white gerbils . Head tilts , lack of good balance , and repetitive running and circling has been reported in these gerbils . It has been found that these health concerns mostly affect gerbils with unpigmented ( light pink/not very opaque ) ears . There are other spotting types . Any that do n't conform to show standards are usually classed as patched . Note : Although some US gerbil owners call some coat varieties fox i.e. yellow fox , the fox gene is not in gerbils and this is therefore incorrect . # Breeding # Though not much is known about breeding in wild Mongolian gerbils , we know that they can have as many as 18 pups , compared to pet gerbils which can only have 14 . The families make sure all young females in their groups leave before that can fall pregnant and kill the mothers newer pups whilst still in the family unit . The father or older brothers will mate with younger females . These young females have the ability to carry sperm for up to 2 weeks until they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make a family of their own without the interference of another male who may kill the fathers pups . This is why it is n't recommended to keep an older male gerbil with a younger female as a cage mate for a prolonged amount of time .
