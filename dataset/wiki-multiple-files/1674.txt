In 1954 , construction began on the limited-access portion of US 13 in Bucks County with the section from U.S. Route 1 to Tyburn Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tullytown opening in 1956 . U.S. Route 13 was moved to this expressway from its former alignment which followed Bristol Pike between Tullytown and Morrisville . At the time of its completion , this expressway was planned to be a part of Interstate 95 , with the highway leaving its current alignment at Exit 40 ( Pennsylvania Route 413 ) and following US 13 up to US 1 , where it would head north into Trenton by way of the Trenton-Morrisville Toll Bridge . However , New Jersey officials opposed this plan , and I-95 was routed to cross the Delaware River on the Scudders Falls Bridge . In 1969 , another plan was created to build a US 13 expressway that would provide a direct connection between I-95 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike ( Interstate 276 ) . It would have run from Exit 40 of I-95 , intersect the PA Turnpike , and head to the southern end of the completed US 13 expressway in Tullytown . It was eventually cancelled due to feared environmental impacts on Silver Lake Park . # Major intersections # notes=Delaware border notes= notes= notes=Interchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlap notes= notes=North end of PA 3 west overlap notes=I-76 Exit 342 ; Brief overlap between US 13 northbound and US 30 westbound notes= notes=Interchange ; south end of US 1 overlap ; southbound exit and northbound entrance notes=Interchange ( Oxford Circle ) notes=North end of US 1 overlap notes= notes=Partial cloverleaf interchange notes= notes=Partial cloverleaf interchange notes= notes=I-276 Exit 358 notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance
