The four major leagues comprise Major League Baseball , the National Football League , the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League . The championships won are recorded for the cities only , not the individual franchises . When a team relocates to a new city , the number of championships won in that specific city remain with the city . Championships are only from the preeminent league in each of the four major sports . NFL World Championships include all AFL &amp; NFL Championship Games prior to Super Bowl I. The AFL is the only professional rival league to exist 100% . NFL World Championships include the Super Bowl from 1966Present , AFL Championships from 1960-1965 and NFL Championship Games from 1933-1965 .
