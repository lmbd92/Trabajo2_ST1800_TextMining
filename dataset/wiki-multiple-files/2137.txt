In 1110 , 1112 , and 1114 the city of Edessa was the objective ; in 1113 Galilee was invaded , and in 1111 and 1115 the Latin possessions which lay east of the Orontes between Aleppo and Shaizar . The attack on Edessa in 1110 failed to take the city . In 1111 , Mawdud of Mosul led a host which fought Baldwin I 's Frankish army to a draw in the Battle of Shaizar . Afterward , the Muslim leader 's army dispersed because of its lack of success and plunder . In 1112 and 1114 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other four years , the Crusader states - the Kingdom of Jerusalem , Principality of Antioch , County of Tripoli and County of Edessa - joined forces in defense . # Battle # In 1113 , Mawdud joined Toghtekin of Damascus and their combined army aimed to cross the Jordan River south of the Sea of Galilee . Baldwin I offered battle near the bridge of Al-Sannabra . Mawdud used the device of a feigned flight to entice Baldwin I into rashly ordering a charge . The Frankish army was surprised and beaten when it unexpectedly ran into the main Turkish army . The surviving Crusaders kept their cohesion and fell back to a hill west of the inland sea where they fortified their camp . In this position they were reinforced from Tripoli and Antioch but remained inert . A number of Christian pilgrims also rallied to the army after Al-Sannabra . Unable to annihilate the Crusaders , Mawdud watched them with his main army while sending raiding columns to ravage the countryside and sack the town of Nablus . In this , Mawdud anticipated the strategy of Saladin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belvoir Castle ( 1182 ) and the Battle of Al-Fule ( 1183 ) . As in these campaigns , the Frankish field army could oppose the main Muslim army , but it could not stop raiding forces from doing great damage to crops and towns . While the Turkish raiders roamed freely through Crusader lands , the local Muslim farmers entered into friendly relations with them . This deeply troubled the Frankish land magnates , who ultimately depended upon rents from cultivators of the soil . # Aftermath # Mawdud was unable to make any permanent conquests after his victory . Soon afterward , he was assassinated and Aq-Sunqur Bursuqi took command of the failed attempt against Edessa in 1114 . Roger of Salerno routed the last Seljuk invading army at the Battle of Sarmin after a protracted campaign in 1115
