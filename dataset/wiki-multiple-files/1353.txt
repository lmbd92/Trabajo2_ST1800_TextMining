@@8206514 Pequeas Ancdotas Sobre las Instituciones ( ' ' Small Anecdotes about the Institutions ' ' ) is the third album of Argentine group Sui Generis , released on 1974 . When first released , the album was n't as welcomed by the audience as its two predecessors had been . Though Folk rock in nature , it had an important inspiration in Progressive Rock , a genre that was n't too well known and accepted by the majority of listeners . With the passage of time , it would inspire new generations of Argentine musicians and become a classic in its own right . # Track listing # # Instituciones ( Institutions ) ( Garca ) - 4 ' 50 # Tango en segunda ( Garca ) - 3 ' 32 # El show de los muertos ( The Show of The Dead ) ( Garca ) - 6 ' 04 # Las increbles aventuras del Seor Tijeras ( The Incredible Adventures of Mr. Scissors ) ( Garca ) - 5 ' 51 # Pequeas delicias de la vida conyugal ( Small Delights of the Spousal Life ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y los ciegos ( The One-Eyed and the Blind ) ( Garca ) - 2 ' 02 # Msica de fondo para cualquier fiesta animada ( Background Music for Any Lively Party ) ( Garca ) - 4 ' 32 # Tema de Natalio ( Natalio 's Theme ) ( Garca-Rafanelli ) - 6 ' 00 # Para quien canto yo entonces ( Who am I Singing For , Then ? ) ( Garca ) - 3 ' 42 # Juan Represin * ( Garca ) - 3 ' 25 # Botas locas ( Crazy Boots ) * ( Garca ) - 4 ' 58 ( * ) Bonus tracks on remastered version . # Album credits # # The Group # *Charly Garca - piano , electric piano , mini Moog , clavinet , ARP string ensemble , electric guitar , vocals *Nito Mestre - acoustic guitar , recorder , vocals *Rinaldo Rafanelli - bass , electric guitar , vocals *Juan Rodrguez - drums , percussion # Guests # *David Lebn - electric guitar *Alejandro Correa - bass *Carlos Cutaia - organ *Jorge Pinchevsky - violin *Len Gieco - harmonica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bond - chorus # Production # *Producer : Jorge lvarez *Engineer : Billy Bond
