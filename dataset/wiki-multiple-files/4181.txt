Construction on the quadrangle began in 1854 , it had four sides by 1926 , and was completed in the 1960s after several stages of development . It comprises the Great Hall , Faculty of Arts office and the Nicholson Museum . The main entrance is underneath the clock tower .

He embarked on a restoration program , for which he became known as the building vice chancellor . # Architecture # The Quadrangle design is based on those of Oxford and Cambridge . It contains one of only two carillons in Australia , the other being the one on Aspen Island in Canberra . There is a kangaroo on the clocktower ( right hand side , facing towards the city ) that is different from the other gargoyles built there .

Waterhouse in preparation for a visit by the Duke and Duchess of York to the university in 1927 . A number of trees planted earlier by Waterhouse had been cut down in 1938 , possibly as a prank , but the jacaranda tree that survived was too large for students to remove . It has grown to more than 18 metres in diameter . # References #
