They operate bank branches in Minnesota , Wisconsin , and North Dakota , with a financial capitalization of about $8 billion . With headquarters in St. Paul , Minnesota , the company is completely owned by employees and the Otto Bremer Foundation . # History # Otto Bremer was born in Germany in 1867 , son of a banker father . He immigrated to the US in 1886 , with his brother Adolf . He was hired as a bookkeeper at the National German American Bank in St. Paul , Minnesota . During the next decades , he was promoted to higher positions , and became a major stockholder in the bank . In 1921 , he became Chairman of the new American National Bank , and continued as Chair for 20 years . During the Great Depression , from 1929 thru the 1930s , Bremer invested money in many small town banks in the area , often showing up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the mid-30 's , he held stock in 55 banks in the area . He had also risked the full capital value of the bank , and had to be rescued by his brother Adolf , who pledged the shares in Schmidt Brewing Company held by him and his wife ( Marie Schmidt Bremer , the daughter of brewery founder Jacob Schmidt ) . In 1934 , Edward Bremer , a banker and nephew of Otto , was kidnapped by the Karpis-Barker gang in broad daylight , as he was dropping off his daughter at the Summit School in St. Paul . This kidnapping , together with that of brewing heir William Hamm , Jr. , brought an end to the ' ' O'Connor agreement ' ' , whereby St. Paul Police Chief John O'Connor allowed such gangsters to use St. Paul as a safe haven , provided they committed no crimes within the city . The Bremer family paid a ransom of $200,000 ; the Hamm family $100,000 , and both victims were released unharmed , after about a week . In 1943 , Otto created the Otto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these banks ( by this time , he was the major or sole owner of most of them ) . He also created the Otto Bremer Foundation in 1944 , as a charitable organization to grant funds for public purposes in the small towns where there was a Bremer bank . The Foundation was funded from the profits of the Bremer bank holding company . As of 2009 , the Foundation donates about $25 million each year . In addition , bank employees are strongly encouraged to volunteer in local town activities . Each year , these employees donate more than 100,000 volunteer hours . When Otto Bremer died in 1951 , he left most of his fortune , and his stock in the Otto Bremer Bank Company to the Otto Bremer Foundation . The Foundation remains the major owner of the Bremer Bank Company , holding about 92% of the stock . The remaining stock is owned by employees or retired employees of the company .
