He is the Frank H. T. Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters , Emeritus , at Cornell University , in Ithaca , New York . # Early life # # Escape from the Holocaust # Hoffmann was born in Zolochiv , Poland ( now Ukraine ) , to a Jewish family , and was named in honor of the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen . His parents were Clara ( Rosen ) , a teacher , and Hillel Safran , a civil engineer . After Germany invaded Poland and occupied the town , his family was placed in a labor camp where his father , who was familiar with much of the local infrastructure , was a valued prisoner . As the situation grew more dangerous , with prisoners being transferred to liquidation camps , the family bribed guards to allow an escape and arranged with Ukrainian neighbors for Hoffman , his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic and a storeroom of the local schoolhouse , where they remained for fifteen months , while Hoffman was aged 5 to 7 . His father remained at the labor camp , but was able to occasionally visit , until he was tortured and killed by the Germans for his involvement in a plot to arm the camp prisoners . When she received the news , his mother attempted to contain her sorrow by writing down her feelings in a notebook her husband had been using to take notes on a relativity textbook he had been reading . While in hiding his mother kept Hoffman entertained by teaching him to read and having him memorize geography from textbooks stored in the attic , then quizzing him on it . He referred to the experience as having been enveloped in a cocoon of love . Most of the rest of the family perished in the Holocaust , though one grandmother and a few others survived . They migrated to the United States in 1949 .

In 2009 , a monument to Holocaust victims was built in Zolochiv on Hoffmann 's initiative . # Academic credentials # Hoffmann graduated in 1955 from New York City 's Stuyvesant High School , where he won a Westinghouse science scholarship . He received his Bachelor of Arts degree at Columbia University ( Columbia College ) in 1958 . He earned his Master of Arts degree in 1960 from Harvard University . He earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Harvard University while working under direction of subsequent 1976 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner William N. Lipscomb , Jr . Under Lipscomb 's direction the Extended Hckel method was developed by Lawrence Lohr and by Roald Hoffmann . This method was later extended by Hoffmann . He went to Cornell in 1965 and has remained there , becoming professor emeritus . # Chemistry interests # Hoffmann has investigated both organic and inorganic substances , developing computational tools and methods such as the extended Hckel method , which he proposed in 1963 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for elucidating reaction mechanisms ( the WoodwardHoffmann rules ) . He also introduced the isolobal principle . # ' ' The World Of Chemistry ' ' with Roald Hoffmann # Hoffmann is the co-host of the Annenberg/CPB educational series , ' ' The World of Chemistry ' ' , with Don Showalter. # Artistic interests # Hoffmann is also a writer of poetry published in two collections , ' ' The Metamict State ' ' ( 1987 , ISBN 0-8130-0869-7 ) and ' ' Gaps and Verges ' ' ( 1990 , ISBN 0-8130-0943-X ) , and of books explaining chemistry to the general public . Also , he co-authored with Carl Djerassi the play ' ' Oxygen ' ' , about the discovery of oxygen , but also about what it means to be a scientist and the importance of process of discovery in science . Hoffmann stars in ' ' The World of Chemistry ' ' video series with Don Showalter .
