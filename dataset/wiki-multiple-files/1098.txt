@@5981514 The Standing Buddha of the Tokyo National Museum is a remarkable example of Greco-Buddhist statuary . Comparable ones can be found in the Musee Guimet in France , and in the National Museum , New Delhi besides various other museums of South Asia . The statue is dated by the museum to the 1st or 2nd century CE. # Context # Some of the standing Buddhas ( as the one pictured ) were sculpted using the specific Greek technique of making the hands and sometimes the feet in marble to increase the realistic effect , and the rest of the body in another material .

He sent an envoy to the Yuezhi in northwestern India , who brought back paintings and statues of the Buddha , confirming their existence before that date : : ' ' The Emperor , to discover the true doctrine , sent an envoy to Tianzhu ( Northwestern India ) to inquire about the Buddha 's doctrine , after which paintings and statues of the Buddha appeared in the Middle Kingdom .
