@@5220514 The giant peccary ( ' ' Pecari maximus ' ' ) is a possible fourth species of peccary , discovered in Brazil in 2000 by Dutch naturalist Marc van Roosmalen . In 2003 , he and German natural history filmmaker Lothar Frenz succeeded in filming a group and gathering material , which later would serve as the type . Though recently reported , it has been known to locals as ' ' caitetu munde ' ' , which means great peccary which lives in pairs . It was formally described in 2007 , but the scientific evidence for its species status has later been questioned , which also is one of the reasons for it being evaluated as data deficient by IUCN . Its assumed range encompass the south-central Amazon between the Madeira and the Tapajs Rivers . It is restricted to Terra Firme forest . Unlike other peccaries in its range , the giant peccary appears to mainly occur in pairs or small family groups . According to its original description , the giant peccary is larger , longer-legged , and proportionally smaller-headed than the only other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' P. tajacu ' ' ) . Compared to the sympatric populations of the collared peccary , the giant peccary also has thinner fur that is grizzled in brown and white , blacker legs , and a relatively faint collar . Five skins of the giant peccary had a total length of 120137 cm ( 4754 in ) , while local hunters have estimated a weight of 4050 kg ( 88110 lb ) . Based on mtDNA , the collared and the giant peccaries are estimated to have diverged 1.01.2 million years ago , but these results have been considered questionable due to the low bootstrap support , small sample size , and the absence of nDNA and cytogenetic results . Furthermore , extensive intraspecific variations ( both individual and locality-based ) are known in the morphology of the collared peccary.
