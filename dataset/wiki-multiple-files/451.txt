@@1621514 Lunar craters are craters on Earth 's Moon . The Moon 's surface is saturated with craters , almost all of which were formed by impacts . # History # The word ' ' crater ' ' was adopted by Galileo from the Greek word for vessel - ( a Greek vessel used to mix wine and water ) . Galileo built his first telescope in late 1609 , and turned it to the Moon for the first time on November 30 , 1609 . He discovered that , contrary to general opinion at that time , the Moon was not a perfect sphere , but had both mountains and cup-like depressions , the latter of which he gave the name ' ' craters ' ' . Scientific opinion as to the origin of craters swung back and forth over the ensuing centuries . The competing theories were ( a ) volcanic eruptions blasting holes in the Moon , ( b ) meteoric impact , ( c ) a theory known as the Welteislehre developed in Germany between the two World Wars which suggested glacial action creating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmanned spacecraft of the same period proved conclusively that meteoric impact , or impact by asteroids for larger craters , was the origin of almost all lunar craters , and by implication , most craters on other bodies as well . The formation of new craters is studied in the lunar impact monitoring program at NASA . The biggest recorded creation was caused by an impact recorded on March 17 , 2013 . The explosion which was visible with the naked eye , is believed to be from an approximately 40 kg meteoroid hitting the moon with a speed of 90000 km/h. # Characteristics # Because of the Moon 's lack of water , and atmosphere , or tectonic plates , there is little erosion , and craters are found that exceed two billion years in age . The age of large craters is determined by the number of smaller craters contained within it , older craters generally accumulating more small , contained craters . The smallest craters found have been microscopic in size , found in rocks returned to Earth from the Moon . The largest crater called such is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunar South Pole . However , it is believed that many of the lunar maria were formed by giant impacts , with the resulting depression filled by upwelling lava . Craters typically will have some or all of the following features : *a surrounding area with materials splashed out of the ground when the crater was formed ; this is typically lighter in shade than older materials due to exposure to solar radiation for a lesser time *raised rim , consisting of materials ejected but landing very close by *crater wall , the downward-sloping portion of the crater *crater floor , a more or less smooth , flat area , which as it ages accumulates small craters of its own *central peak , found only in some craters with a diameter exceeding 16 mi ; this is generally a splash effect caused by the kinetic energy of the impacting object being turned to heat and melting some lunar material . # Lunar crater categorization # In 1978 , Chuck Wood and Leif Andersson of the Lunar &amp; Planetary Lab devised a system of categorization of lunar impact craters. # Locations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the location of the named crater feature on the near side of the Moon . <gallery> Image:Location of albategnius crater.jpg <center> Albategnius </center> Image:Location of lunar aristarchus crater.jpg <center> Aristarchus </center> Image:Location of lunar aristoteles crater.jpg <center> Aristoteles </center> Image:Location of lunar bailly crater.jpg <center> Bailly </center> Image:Location of lunar crater clavius.jpg <center> Clavius </center> Image:Location of lunar crater copernicus.jpg <center> Copernicus </center> Image:Location of lunar crater fra mauro.jpg <center> Fra Mauro </center> Image:Location of lunar crater humboldt.jpg <center> Humboldt </center> Image:Location of lunar crater janssen.jpg <center> Janssen </center> Image:Location of lunar crater langrenus.jpg <center> Langrenus </center> Image:Location of lunar crater longomontanus.jpg <center> Longomontanus </center> Image:Location of lunar crater maginus.jpg <center> Maginus </center> Image:Location of lunar crater metius.jpg <center> Metius </center> Image:Location of lunar crater moretus.jpg <center> Moretus </center> Image:Location of lunar crater petavius.jpg <center> Petavius </center> Image:Location of lunar crater picard.jpg <center> Picard </center> Image:Location of lunar crater piccolomini.jpg <center> Piccolomini </center> Image:Location of lunar crater pitatus.jpg <center> Pitatus </center> Image:Location of lunar crater plinius.jpg <center> Plinius </center> Image:Location of lunar crater rheita.jpg <center> Rheita </center> Image:Location of lunar crater russell.jpg <center> Russell </center> Image:Location of lunar crater schickard.jpg <center> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Image:Location of lunar crater stadius.jpg <center> Stadius </center> Image:Location of lunar crater stofler.jpg <center> Stfler </center> Image:Location of lunar crater thebit.jpg <center> Thebit </center> Image:Location of lunar crater theophilus.jpg <center> Theophilus </center> Image:Lage des Mondkraters Tycho.jpg <center> Tycho </center> Image:Location of lunar crater vendelinus.jpg <center> Vendelinus </center> Image:Location of lunar crater wargentin.jpg <center> Wargentin </center> </gallery>
