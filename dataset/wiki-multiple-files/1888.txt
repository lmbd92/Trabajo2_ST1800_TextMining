The 1972 Dolphins are the only National Football League team to win the Super Bowl with a perfect season . The undefeated campaign was led by coach Don Shula and notable players Bob Griese , Earl Morrall , and Larry Csonka . The 1972 Dolphins went 140 in the regular season and won all three post-season games , including Super Bowl VII against the Washington Redskins , to finish 170 . The team remains the only NFL team to complete an entire season undefeated and untied from the opening game through the Super Bowl ( or championship game ) . In addition , the Dolphins continued their winning streak to 18 straight games ( regular season and post-season ) , before losing in the second week of the 1973 season .

Paul Warfield led the receivers , averaging over 20 yards per catch on 29 receptions . The offensive line included future Hall of Fame members Jim Langer and Larry Little and Pro Bowler Norm Evans . The 1972 Dolphins defensive unit , called the ' ' No-Name Defense ' ' because Miamis impressive offense received much more publicity , as well as Cowboy 's coach , Tom Landry , coining the phrase in an interview , was the leagues best that year . It was led by linebacker Nick Buoniconti , end Bill Stanfill , tackle Manny Fernandez , and safeties Dick Anderson and Jake Scott .

Coach Don Shula tried to play down the myth by saying that two players , Dick Anderson and Nick Buoniconti , who live near each other sometimes have a toast together . However , in a college football broadcast on ABC , following the loss of an undefeated team , Bob Griese , after being asked by his colleague , commented that he called former Dolphins , and they had Diet Cokes together . That celebration comes with the connotation that they no longer drink alcoholic beverages , but that a toast was customary . # The perfect season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute a perfect regular season in the post-merger NFL . They are the only team in NFL history to go undefeated and untied in the regular season and postseason . An enduring controversy is that the 1972 Dolphins played a soft schedule not possible under the current scheduling formula . Prior to the implementation of position scheduling in 1978 , opponents were set by the NFL on a rotating basis . Statistically , the Dolphins 1972 regular-season opponents had an aggregate winning percentage of .397 and only two opponents had winning records that year ( both were 86 ) . This is not however a record : the 1975 Minnesota Vikings , who began 100 and finished 122 , played fourteen opponents with an average winning percentage of .332 and nine of their games were against teams 410 or worse .

Super Bowl VII , in fact , was the first game to be televised in the market of origin under new rules which would come into effect the following season games must be sold out within 72 hours of kickoff time in order to be aired in the market of origin . As all Super Bowls except the first have sold out , none have been blacked out since ( tickets sell out rather quickly due to high demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House visit # Four decades later in 2013 , the team was invited by President Barack Obama to visit the White House . This occurred on August 20 , where Obama noted that the team never got their White House visit . As to why this team had not been invited by President Richard Nixon in 1973 , Larry Csonka stated that he did not feel neglected as it had not been a regular occurrence at the time . However , MSNBC reported that this was a deliberate snub by Nixon who was a Redskins fan . Obama had previously invited the ' 85 Bears to the White House , as their visit had gotten cancelled due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster . President Obama , a Chicago resident and Bears fan , had called them the greatest team ever , but during the Dolphins ' visit he called his own words into question , also noting that the only loss the ' 85 Bears had was to the Dolphins .
