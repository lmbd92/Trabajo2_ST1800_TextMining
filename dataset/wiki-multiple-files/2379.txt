@@19883514 In vehicle acrobatics , a wheelie , or wheelstand , Wheelies appear in popular culture as early as 1943 , as U.S Army motorized cavalry are pictured in Life magazine performing high speed wheelies . Daredevil Evel Knievel performed motorcycle acrobatics including wheelies in his shows . Doug The Wheelie King Domokos has accomplished such feats as a 145 mi wheelie . # Types of wheelie # Types of wheelies can be divided into two broad categories : : 1 . wheelies in which the vehicle power is sufficient by itself , as described in the Physics section below . These include : : * Clutch wheelies - performed by disengaging the clutch and opening the throttle to let the engine race and then engaging the clutch abruptly . : * Power wheelies or roll-on wheelies - performed by simply opening the throttle . If the engine has sufficient power , it will be able to lift the front wheel . : 2. wheelies performed with the aid of suspension dynamics or rider motion . These include : : * Bounce wheelies or slap wheelies - performed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tire rebounding , rider motion , or any combination of the three . : * Manuals - performed without applying torque to the rear wheel at all , but instead by moving the rider 's body backwards relative to the bike , and then pulling back on the handlebars near the end of available travel . # Bicycles # Wheelies are a common stunt in artistic cycling and freestyle BMX . The bike is balanced by the rider 's weight and sometimes use of the rear brake . A style of bicycle , the wheelie bike , has a seating position , and thus center of mass , nearly over the rear wheel that facilitates performing wheelies . # Motorcycles # A wheelie is also a common motorcycle stunt . The principle is the same as the bicycle wheelie , but the throttle and rear-brakes are used to control the wheelie while a rider uses body weight and the steering to control the direction the inertia of the spinning front wheel acting as a balance . The world 's fastest motorcycle wheelie record is 307.86 km/h by Patrick Furstenhoff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast wheelie over 1kmmi 1 is 172.9 mph , set in September 2006 by Terry Calcott at Elvington airfield in Yorkshire , England . In some countries , such as the United Kingdom and USA , motorcyclists performing a wheelie on a public road may be prosecuted for dangerous driving , an offense which can carry a large fine and a ban of a year or more . In Pakistan , India , and some other countries its illegal to perform these kinds of stunts . If someone is caught performing these acts , they can have their motorcycle impounded and potentially face jail time . # Automobiles # Wheelies are common in auto- or motorcycle drag racing , where they represent torque wasted lifting the front end , rather than moving the vehicle forward . # Wheelie bars # Wheelie bars help prevent a vehicle 's front end from raising too high or flipping over . Wheelie bars are required for some tractor and truck pull events . <ref> cite web # Physics # A wheelie is imminent when the acceleration is sufficient to reduce the load borne by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Ski ( driving stunt ) * Stoppie * Weight transfer # Notes # de:Fahrtechnik#Auf dem Hinterrad fahren
