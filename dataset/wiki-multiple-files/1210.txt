@@6941514 The Hobart Devils is a defunct basketball team that competed in Australia 's National Basketball League ( NBL ) . Based in Hobart , Tasmania , the team was the only representative from the state of Tasmania for the majority of its tenure , but was one of three teams ( the Geelong Supercats and the Gold Coast Rollers being the other two ) that had their NBL licenses revoked by the league directors in 1996 due to financial difficulties . While not the first time teams had folded in the league , the sudden departure of the Devils , Supercats and Rollers signified that the NBL 's successful era ( between the late 1980s and early 1990s ) was truly over . The state of Tasmania has not fielded a side in the NBL since the departure of the Devils and the re-emergence of any Tasmanian sides in the near future seems unlikely . The club played out of the Kingborough Sports Centre from 1983-1988 . From the 1989 NBL season they then moved into the larger and more modern Derwent Entertainment Centre where they stayed until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the club a larger venue , but the Tassie Devils left their magic at Kingborough , where they had been very hard to defeat always in the role of the underdog in 1986 , 1987 and 1988 and these three years played before sellout crowds in the cozy 1,800 seat arena . During Devils home games the home court arena was often referred to as the Devils Den by local TV commentators . The Devils enjoyed their most successful , and only winning season in NBL competition , in 1987 notching a 14 win 12 loss league record . That team featured good chemistry and a high powered offense , it included key players Steve Carfino , Paul Stanley , Jerry Dennard , Wayne Burden , Peter Mann , Rick Hodges and was coached by American Dave Doc Adkins and led by club president , Tasmanian Wayne Monaghan . The club was known as Hobart Tassie Devils from 1987 to 1995 , but reverted to Hobart Devils in its final season .
