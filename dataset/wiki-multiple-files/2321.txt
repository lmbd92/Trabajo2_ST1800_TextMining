@@19081514 Stigler 's law concerns the supposed tendency of eponymous expressions for scientific discoveries to honor people other than their respective originators . Examples include : # A # * AharonovBohm effect . Werner Ehrenberg and Raymond E. Siday first predicted the effect in 1949 , and similar effects were later rediscovered by Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm in 1959. * Alzheimer 's disease , though named after Alois Alzheimer , had been previously described by at least half a dozen others before Alzheimer 's 1906 report which is often ( wrongly ) regarded as the first description of the disorder . * America , named after Amerigo Vespucci ( the name was given by German cartographers Martin Waldseemller and Matthias Ringmann ) , although Vespucci was not the first European to find either North or South America . He participated only to expeditions on the eastern coast of South America , and was not even in command of all of those expeditions . Many other explorers found different parts of the continent before and after him . Those include , for example , Christopher Columbus , who predated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americas , yet he was also predated by the Norse Vikings , led by Leif Ericson , who found Newfoundland . * Arabic numerals , which were invented in India . * Arrhenius equation . The equation was first proposed by the Dutch chemist J. H. van ' t Hoff in 1884 ; five years later in 1889 , the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for it . * Auger effect . First discovered by Lise Meitner in 1922 and then , independently , in 1923 by Pierre Victor Auger . *Avogadro constant . While the work of Amedeo Avogadro predicted the idea of a set number of molecules in a set weight of a substance , the actual constant was discovered by Jean Baptiste Perrin some 53 years after Avogadro 's death . # B # * Bechdel Test , a gender bias test for films popularised by and named after ' ' Dykes to Watch Out For ' ' comic strip writer Alison Bechdel , despite her repeated insistence that the test was devised by her friend Liz Wallace . * Benford 's law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1938 , although it had been previously stated by Simon Newcomb in 1881. * The Bessemer process was discovered by William Kelly in 1851 .

First discovered by Henry Wilbraham in 1851. * Gresham 's law was described by Nicolaus Copernicus in 1519 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis : the theory was developed by Bruno Buchberger , who named them after his advisor , Wolfgang Grbner # HI # * Halley 's comet was observed by astronomers since at least 240 BC , but named after Edmond Halley who computed its orbit and accurately predicted its return . * Hasse diagrams were used by Henri Gustav Vogt three years before the birth of Helmust Hasse. * Higgs boson is named after Peter Higgs but was first theorized by Robert Brout and Franois Englert * HodrickPrescott filter was popularized in the field of economics in the 1990s by economists Robert J. Hodrick and Nobel Memorial Prize winner Edward C. Prescott . However , it was first proposed much earlier by E. T. Whittaker in 1923. * Hubble 's law was derived by Georges Lematre two years before Edwin Hubble . # J # * Jacobson 's organ was first discovered by Frederik Ruysch before 1732. * Joukowski transformation was first derived by Otto Blumenthal in 1913. # K # * Kasiski analysis : invented by Charles Babbage who recorded it in his diary but did n't otherwise publish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomers several days before Johannes Kepler * Killing form : invented by lie Cartan * Kuiper belt : theoretically described by a number of astronomers before Gerard Kuiper ; Kuiper theorized that such a belt no longer existed . # L # * L'Hpital 's rule to calculate the limit of quotient of functions at a point were both functions converge to 0 ( or both converge to infinity ) is named after Guillaume de l'Hpital , but is generally believed to have been discovered by Johann Bernoulli. * Lamarckism is generally used to refer to the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics or soft inheritance , but the idea predates Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and was not the central part of his theory of transmutation of species . * Leibniz formula for : The formula was first discovered by 15th-century Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama , but it is named after Gottfried Leibniz after the latter discovered it independently 300 years later . * Lexis diagram is named after Wilhelm Lexis but was previously theorized by Gustav Zeuner and Otto Brasche. * The Liebig condenser , which Justus von Liebig popularized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been developed independently by Poisonnier , Weigel , and Gadolin. * Linus 's law : named after Linus Torvalds , but actually described by Eric S.

The actual nature of the metalsemiconductor junction was noted by Hans Bethe. * Simpson 's paradox , a term introduced by Colin R. Blyth in 1972 ; but Edward Simpson did not actually discover this statistical paradox . * Snell 's law of refraction , named after Willebrord Snellius , a Dutch scientist , also known as Descartes law of refraction ( after Ren Descartes ) was discovered by Ibn Sahl. * Stokes 's theorem discovered by Lord Kelvin * Stigler 's Law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TU # * The Tetralogy of Fallot was described in 1672 by Niels Stensen , but named after tienne-Louis Arthur Fallot who also described it in 1888. * Taylor 's law in ecology was discovered by H. Fairfield Smith in 1938 but named after L. R. Taylor who rediscovered it in 1961. # V # * Venn diagrams are named after John Venn , who popularized them in the 1880s , but Leonhard Euler had already introduced them in 1768. * Vigenre cipher was originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book ' ' La cifra del . Sig . Giovan Battista Bellaso ' ' , but later misattributed to Blaise de Vigenre in the 19th century . * Voronoi diagrams are named after Georgy Voronoy , who defined and studied the general n-dimensional case in 1908 , but have already been used by Descartes ( 1644 ) , Lejeune Dirichlet ( 1850 ) and Snow ( 1854 ) . # WX # * Wang tiles were hypothesized by Hao Wang not to exist , but an example was constructed by his student Robert Berger . * Wheatstone bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1833 , but named after Sir Charles Wheatstone who improved and popularized it in 1843. * Wike 's law of low odd primes , a principle of design of experiments , was stated by Sir Ronald A. Fisher in 1935 but named by Edwin Wike in 1973. # YZ # * Yagi-Uda antenna , a successful and popular beam antenna , whose primary inventor was Shintaro Uda , but which was popularized by , and formerly popularly named for , his collaborator Hidetsugu Yagi. # Similar cases # * BaileyBorweinPlouffe formula was discovered by Simon Plouffe , who has since expressed regret at having to share credit for his discovery .
