@@38514 In the 1980s the telecommunications industry expected that digital services would follow much the same pattern as voice services did on the public switched telephone network , and conceived an end-to-end circuit switched services , known as Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network ( B-ISDN ) . Before B-ISDN , the original ISDN attempted to substitute the analog telephone system with a digital system which was appropriate for both voice and non-voice traffic . Obtaining worldwide agreement on the basic rate interface standard was expected to lead to a large user demand for ISDN equipment , hence leading to mass production and inexpensive ISDN chips . However , the standardization process took years while computer network technology moved rapidly . Once the ISDN standard was finally agreed upon and products were available , it was already obsolete . For home use the largest demand for new services was video and voice transfer , but the ISDN basic rate lacks the necessary channel capacity . For business , ISDN 's 64 kbit/s data rate compared unfavorably to 10 Mbit/s local area networks such as Ethernet . This led to introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term had a meaning in physics and engineering ( similar to wideband ) , the CCITT defined it as : Qualifying a service or system requiring transmission channels capable of supporting rates greater than the primary rate referring to the primary rate which ranged from about 1.5 to 2 Mbit/s . Services envisioned included video telephone and video conferencing . Technical papers were published in early 1988 . Standards were issued by the Comit Consultatif International Tlphonique et Tlgraphique ( CCITT , now known as ITU-T ) , and called Recommendations . They included G.707 to G.709 , and I.121 which defined the principal aspects of B-ISDN , with many others following through the 1990s . The designated technology for B-ISDN was Asynchronous Transfer Mode ( ATM ) , which was intended to carry both synchronous voice and asynchronous data services on the same transport . The B-ISDN vision has been overtaken by other disruptive technologies used in the Internet . The ATM technology survived as a low-level layer in most Digital subscriber line ( DSL ) technologies , and as a payload type in some wireless technologies such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any digital Internet access service .
