@@14707514 genre = Action , strategy ' ' Airheart ' ' is a 1986 video game for the Apple II . It was designed and programmed by Dan Gorlin and published by Brderbund . It requires an Apple IIe enhanced ( or later ) to run , as it uses double hi-res graphics . # Development # Gorlin had great success with his first title , ' ' Choplifter ' ' , which he developed in about six months . This title , however , took about three years to develop . This is in large part because he also developed other games which he lost interest in and never completed and also because he did a lot of research and built a number of tools to help in game development . Gorlin was unable to include all the features he planned . At one point , for example , he had tunnel and underwater levels working , but was unable to complete them due to time constraints . Tunnels and islands , in fact , were key elements of his original vision for the game , but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gorlin and his team created the largest version of each sprite by hand and then used proprietary tools to create the about twenty smaller versions of the sprite . Storing these sprites in RAM , they were able to simulate scaling in realtime . Though the sprites used a lot of memory , it was the only method that satisfied Gorlin since he hated the low-polygon look of other contemporary games . # Gameplay # The name ' ' Airheart ' ' is the title the player aspires to earn . The user controls a jet-propelled flotation device . They must navigate their craft and fight robotic defenders . Spirit guardians instruct the player to collect certain items , such as a sword or a goblet . Gathering the items is a precursor to a final battle to free an infant boy prince . # Legacy # ' ' Airheart ' ' was a precursor to Gorlin 's later game , ' ' Typhoon Thompson in Search for the Sea Child ' ' for 16-bit computers which is closer to what he originally envisioned for this game .
