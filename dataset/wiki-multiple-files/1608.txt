@@11438514 Analog device is usually a combination of both analog machine and analog media that can together measure , record , or reproduce ( emit ) continuous information , for example , the almost infinite number of grades of transparency , voltage , resistance , rotation , or pressure . In theory , the continuous information ( also analog signal ) has an infinite number of possible values with the only limitation on resolution being the accuracy of the analog device . # Examples # # Non-electrical # There are notable non-electrical analog devices , such as clocks ( sundials , water clocks , pendulum clocks , analog watches ) , the astrolabe , slide rules , the governor of a steam engine , the planimeter ( a simple device that measures the area of a closed shape ) , Kelvin 's mechanical tide predictor , acoustic rangefinders , servomechanisms ( e.g. the thermostat ) , a simple mercury thermometer , a bathroom scale , and the speedometer of a car . # Electrical # The telautograph is an analogue precursor to the modern fax machine . Basically it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pen , thus being able to reproduce a drawing or signature made by the sender at the receiver 's station . It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper ; previous inventions in Europe used rotating drums to make such transmissions . An analog synthesizer is a synthesizer that uses analog circuits and analog computer techniques to generate sound electronically . The analog television encodes television and transports the picture and sound information as an analogue signal , that is , by varying the amplitude and/or frequencies of the broadcast signal . All systems preceding digital television , such as NTSC , PAL or UNIT are analog television systems . An analog computer is a form of computer that uses electrical , mechanical or hydraulic phenomena to model the problem being solved . More generally an analog computer uses one kind of physical quantity to represent the behaviour of another physical system , or mathematical function . Modeling a real physical system in a computer is called simulation . # Interfacing the digital and analog worlds # In electronics , a digital-to-analog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting a digital signal ( usually binary ) to an analog signal ( current , voltage or electric charge ) . Digital-to-analog converters are interfaces between the digital world and analog world . An analog-to-digital converter ( abbreviated ADC , A/D or A to D ) is an electronic circuit that converts continuous signals to discrete digital numbers . # Controversy over photographic film # There is quite a bit of controversy in the photographic world as to whether or not a film camera should be considered an analog device since the photographic film is n't a truly analog recording medium and requires chemistry to process an image . Analog has become the common term for referring to cameras that are not digital and is an easy shorthand for people to differentiate between the two mediums .
