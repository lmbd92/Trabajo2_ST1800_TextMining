@@9005514 Bucca is a fairy in Cornish folklore that was believed to be a spirit that inhabited mines and coastal communities as a hobgoblin during storms . The mythogological creature is linked to the Pca from Irish and Welsh folklore . Rev W. S. Lach-Szyrma , one 19th-century writer on Cornish antiquities , suggested the Bucca had originally been an ancient pagan deity of the sea , though his claims are mainly conjecture . Neopagan groups , principally the Witchcraft coven of Ros An Bucca , have began to acknowledge the Bucca in their rites . In the children 's book ' ' Thomas and the Tinners ' ' by Jill Paton Walsh , Buccas have become fairies who work in Cornish tin mines , granting wishes in exchange for food ( see knockers ) . # Folklore # In 1611 , in the Cornish language book the ' ' Creation of the World ' ' the Bucca is mentioned and some believe that the word is a borrowing into Cornish from Old English ' puca ' . A cognate form in Welsh is of similar non-Brythonic Celtic origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does not occur in Brythonic Celtic . According to the Oxford English Dictionary pwca is ultimately of Scandinavian origin . In 1890 , the Cornish folklorist William Bottrell stated that : : It is uncertain whether Bucka can be regarded as one of the fairy tribe ; old people , within my remembrance , spoke of a Bucka Gwidden and a Bucka Dhu - by the former they meant good spirit , and by the latter an evil one , now known as Bucka boo . I have been told , by persons of credit , that within the last forty years it was a usual practice with Newlyn and Mousehole fishermen to leave on the sand at night a portion of their catch for Bucka . Probably from this observance the common nickname of Newlyn Buckas was derived . An old rhyme says : : ' Penzance boys up in a tree , : Looking as wisht ( i.e. ' ' haunted ' ' ) as wisht can be ; : Newlyn buckas as strong as oak , : Knocking them down at every poke . ' In keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time Also in the 19th century , there were reports of fishermen venerating Bucca with offerings . These included food offerings , particularly of fish , given to Bucca on beaches . One such beach used for this purpose was the area of Newlyn known formerly as Park an Grouse ( in Cornish meaning ' the field of the cross ' ) where a stone cross was allegedly once situated . Similar offerings were recorded on the beaches of Mousehole and Newlyn Town ( the area now known as Newlyn Cliff ) . During the 18th and 19th centuries , folklorists generally interpreted the popular beliefs and practices they found as survivals from or relics of Catholicism , equating such ' survivals ' with Paganism . Some also saw the continuation of practices from pre-Christian times . This idea has been discredited in recent years by academic folklorists. although this notion persists in the popular imagination . There is little surprise that the Reverend W. S. Lach-Szyrma should have interpreted Bucca as the storm god of the old Cornish , equating this figure with the Devil . In the 19th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's End and the Tolcarne River ( main stream at the outskirts of Newlyn ) was bridged ; this area was called Bucca 's pass . # References #
