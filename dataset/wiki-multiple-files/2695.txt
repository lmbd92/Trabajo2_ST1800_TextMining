To top all of Taylors problems off , there is a territory war going on between the boarders , the Townies ( kids from the Jellicoe Town ) and the Cadets ( Sydney boys who come for a six-week training exercise every year to Jellicoe ) . The leader of the cadets this year happens to be the very boy who Taylor ran away with when she was 14 in search of her mother . The one who betrayed her trust and she never wants to see again .

Most of the time she is lost in her own world , but she is prone to depression , anxiety , asthma and being unfriendly towards others . She has no idea who her father is and her only memory of him is standing on his shoulders and reaching for the sky .

Jonah , who was traumatized by this act , attempted to commit suicide by jumping in front of a train , but , on the day he planned it , he met Taylor and he decided he did n't want to kill himself in front of her . So instead he catches the train with her , and they travel to Yass . Once they get off , they attempt to hitchhike with a postman to Sydney where Taylor 's mother is supposed to be , but Jonah has a dream from his dead father saying ' if you go any further , you wo n't come back . ' ( although it is revealed later that the postman they rode with was the serial killer that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) So that night , Jonah rings his school , and the next day the Brigadier shows up and takes them both back to Jellicoe . Taylor sees this act as a great betrayal , and she refuses to speak to Jonah again . Chaz Santangelo The incredibly good looking Italian/Aboriginal leader of the Townies ( townsfolk of Jellicoe ) , Chaz is the son of the Chief of Police , Sal and the Mayor , Clara . He is the eldest child and only son , with four younger female siblings - Mary , Elisha , Tilly and Sarah Santangelo who often drive him insane . He 's a sentimental , wise and fair person , who eventually becomes good friends with Taylor and Jonah , and continues to have a highly complicated relationship with Raffy , his childhood friend and complicated love interest .

She was his best friend there , and even his romantic interest . Both their families are good friends . She seems to know the moves of the Townies and often uses her past relationship with Chaz to Jellicoe school 's advantage . Raffy is considered to be a traitor by Chaz and the Townies for attending Jellicoe School . She was an outsider at Jellicoe School in her younger years , along with Taylor and Ben , the Violinist .
