@@22636514 Cyclic succession is a pattern of vegetation change in which in a small number of species tend to replace each other over time in the absence of large-scale disturbance . Observations of cyclic replacement have provided evidence against traditional Clementsian views of an end-state climax community with stable species compositions . Cyclic succession is one of several kinds of ecological succession , a concept in community ecology . When used narrowly , cyclic succession refers to processes not initiated by wholesale exogenous disturbances or long-term physical changes in the environment . However , broader cyclic processes can also be observed in cases of secondary succession in which regular disturbances such as insect outbreaks can reset an entire community to a previous stage . These examples differ from the classic cases of cyclic succession discussed below in that entire species groups are exchanged , as opposed to one species for another . On geologic time scales , climate cycles can result in cyclic vegetation changes by directly altering the physical environment . # History # The cyclic model of succession was proposed in 1947 by British ecologist Alexander Watt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heath , and bog communities , Watt describes the plant community is a regenerating entity consisting of a space-time mosaic of species , whose cyclic behavior can be characterized by patch dynamics . Based on the current composition and its corresponding stage of succession , he explains , a community can either be in an upgrade phase toward late-successional shrubs or downgrade degenerate phase toward grasses . These phases would occur in a predictable cycle . Watts study has since become a classic example frequently cited in scientific ecology . # Modeling cyclic succession # The cyclic model of succession can be displayed in terms of a transition matrix . Based on the Markov chain , the matrix describes the likelihood of future states based on the milieu of present states . The three states in the simplest cyclic model are open substrate ( usually a bare patch of land ) , Species A dominance , and Species B dominance . With respect to facilitation , inhibition , and tolerance models of succession , the key feature of the cyclic model is that A and B are not autosuccessional that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather , A will either facilitate the succession of B or be eliminated ( through mortality ) such that the patch occupied becomes open substrate . Likewise , B will either facilitate the succession of A or be eliminated . Open substrate can remain open or become occupied by either A or B. This configuration results in a cyclic scheme of species dominance . # Mechanisms # Cyclic succession is a descriptive phenomenon that can be accounted for in several ways . In Watts bog system , he suggested that factors endogenous to the plant species were at play . He writes , Each patch in this space-time mosaic is dependent on its neighbours and develops under conditions partly imposed by them . In other words , species life history characteristics fluctuate cyclically under the influence of surrounding species . These periodic shifts in life history properties produce observable changes in community composition . In the system Watt observed , phasic development was specifically responsible for changes in growth and mortality rate . As a result of changes in survival and growth ability , the balance of species dominance shifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships satisfies the conditions described in the model above , a cyclic pattern of succession is observed . Exogenous factors , such as depredation by herbivores , can also be indirect drivers for cyclic succession if they differentially modulate plant life history properties over time . Density-dependent root gnawing by rodents is proposed as one such mechanism in the Larrea-Opuntia system . Watt noted that cyclic fluctuations in mortality rate could also be produced through differential response to seasonal conditions like frost . It is important to note that patterns cyclic succession can not be readily linked to any single species , as Watts ' ' Calluna ' ' bushes have been observed in non-cyclic systems . Rather , it is the aggregate composition of species that gives rise to the cyclic process . # Additional empirical evidence # Strong empirical evidence for cyclic succession can be found in Watts follow-up publication on the bracken system in the Journal of Ecology . ' ' Calluna vulgaris ' ' and ' ' Pteridium aquilinum ' ' were found to replace each other . Another salient example of cyclic replacement occurs in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water availability is limiting such that only one species would be predicted to survive , ' ' Larrea tridentata ' ' and ' ' Opuntia leptocaulis ' ' are observed to replace each other in the absence of environmental disturbance . # Notes # # Further References # *Van der Maarel , Eddy ( 2005 ) .
