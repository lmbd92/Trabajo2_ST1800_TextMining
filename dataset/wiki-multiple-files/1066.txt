Laser pulses delivered through a fiber optic are used to pulverize the stone , avoiding surgery . The technology was licensed to Candela Corporation , which produced the first commercial laser lithotripsy system . # Procedure # A urologist inserts a scope into the urinary tract to locate the stone . The type of the scope may be cystoscope , ureteroscope , renoscope or nephroscope . A laser fiber is inserted through the working channel of the scope , and laser is directly emitted to the stone . The stone is disintegrated and the remaining pieces are washed out of the urinary tract . This procedure is done under either local or general anesthesia and is considered minimally invasive surgery . This procedure is widely available in most hospitals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavelength of 2100nm ( infrared band ) is used to break urinary stones which is ideal for breaking stones ( even hardest ) . In ureteroscopy method , a thin telescope called ureteroscope will be passed through the natural urinary passage from the penis up the bladder into the ureter where the stone is . The Holmium laser fiber can be placed in contact with the stone or adjacent to it . Short Holmium laser pulses create a shockwave that causes fragmentation of the stone . Holmium laser lithotripsy is superior to Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) due to high success rate ( ESWL ca n't break all stones ) and fewer complications . # References #
