It is also deeply influenced by the readings of Deleuze and Guattari and complexity theory , connecting him to the discourse practiced in America by authors such as Jeffrey Kipnis , Sanford Kwinter and Greg Lynn , and by the reading of neomarxist authors , such as Manuel Castells , David Harvey and Henri Lefebvre , which left a strong political bias to his approach to architectural theory . After these early adventures , he succeeded in transferring his early theoretical interests into a viable architectural practice , as a founding partner of Foreign Office Architects ( FOA ) . The experience of architectural practice shifted his critique towards a more pragmatic perspective and addressed to the discussion of the practice of architecture and the analysis of the conditions of production that affect it : the impact of globalisation , information technologies and organisational structures , the discussion of iconography and representation in the cultural and political role of architecture and a political critique of the contemporary building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoretical work addresses . With a characteristic sniper-like style , Zaera Polos recent theoretical work has been published through articles in different media , constantly changing position and location to address contemporary subjects in a poignant and polemical manner . His own Scientific Autobiography charts , as a transcontinental , psycho-geographical drift , a gravitation through some of the most stimulating architectural milieus over the last quarter of a century . Recounting a varied and vivid sequence of cultural exposures , Zaera Polo applies knowledge and experimentalism as he evolves his personal reading of architectural theory and practice - not as dialectically opposed entities , but as a complex continuum . Beyond the theoretical work in El Croquis , his texts have been published in many professional publications such as Quaderns , A+U , Arch+ , Log , Volume and Harvard Design Magazine , and in books including The Endless City and Living in the Endless City ( ed . Richard Burdett and Deyan Sudjic , published by Phaidon , 2008 and 2011 ) . Many of his writings constitute FOAs published texts . # Academic activities # Zaera-Polo has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1993 .
