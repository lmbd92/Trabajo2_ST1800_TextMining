@@11849514 Tobiah was an Ammonite official ( possibly a governor of Ammon , possibly also of Jewish descent ) who incited the Ammonites to hinder Nehemiah 's efforts to rebuild Jerusalem . He , along with Sanballat the Horonite and Geshem the Arab , resorted to a stratagem , and , pretending to wish a conference with Nehemiah , invited him to meet them at Ono , Benjamin . Four times they made the request , and every time Nehemiah refused to come . Their object was to frighten him from completing the restoration of Jerusalem 's walls and to do him some kind of harm . Tobiah also had married a daughter of Shecaniah , a Judahite leader , and had given his son , Jehohanan , in marriage to the daughter of Meshullam , another Judahite leader , for ostensibly political purposes . Because of this , he somehow gained enough of a Judahite coalition to use the Judahites themselves to send letters to Nehemiah , telling him of Tobiah 's good deeds in an apparent attempt to weaken Nehemiah 's resolve to keep Tobiah out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nehemiah . Additionally , Tobiah had established a close relationship with Eliashib the High Priest , whose grandson had married the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite , such that Eliashib leased the storerooms of the temple , intended to be filled with the Israelite 's grain offerings , incense , temple articles , and the tithes of grain , new wine and oil meant for the work of the temple and the temple workers themselves , so that Tobiah could conduct business in the newly constructed temple . Upon hearing this , Nehemiah , who was then in Babylon serving Artaxerxes I , requested permission to return to Judah . After returning , he promptly threw all of Tobiah 's belongings out of the temple room , purified the room , and put back all that had originally been there . It is possible , though uncertain , that Tobiah the Ammonite may be related to other Tobiahs mentioned in extra-biblical sources . The Lachish Ostraca mention a Tobiah who is a servant of the king . Josephus later mentions a rich and influential Tobiad family from around the geographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise related to this same Tobiah.
