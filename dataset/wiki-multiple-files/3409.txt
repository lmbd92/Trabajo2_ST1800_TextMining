The narrative follows the activation of the doomsday device by the parallel universe , and the subsequently devastating consequences experienced by our world . David Wilcox , Josh Singer , and Graham Roland co-wrote the episode , while Jeannot Szwarc directed it . Guest star Kevin Corrigan returned as the mysterious Sam Weiss . Actor John Noble and executive producer Jeff Pinkner have referred to 6:02 AM EST as the start of an epic trilogy , as it and the following two episodes would be linked in one continuous story arc . The episode received generally positive reviews ; many critics noted its purpose was meant to set the stage for the season finale . # Plot # In the parallel universe , Walternate has been able to use the blood sample from Fauxlivia 's child to create a serum made up of half of Peter Bishop 's DNA .

The Fringe division learns that their version of the machine activated at 6:02 AM on its own , and Walter suspects the two machines are tied by quantum entanglement , with their version of the machine destroying their world to stabilize the parallel one . Unknown to the prime universe , Walternate 's experiment has not affected the stability of their world . In the prime universe , Nina Sharp helps to set up Massive Dynamic 's resources to track these occurrences , preparing to deploy limited supplies of the amber substance to contain them if needed . Nina advises Olivia to find Sam Weiss , a man that William Bell had trusted and instructed Nina to also listen to . However , Sam has disappeared and can not be found . Walter and Peter , along with Massive Dynamic staff , debate how to disable the machine , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter comes to recognize that the Observer 's efforts from earlier ( The Firefly ) were to prepare him to lose Peter .

Walternate locks her away , seeing her as a traitor to his cause . # Production # 6:02 AM EST was written by co-executive producers David Wilcox and Josh Singer , and executive story editor Graham Roland ; filmmaker Jeannot Szwarc directed it . Though the season 3 finale was scheduled to be just an hour long , executive producer Jeff Pinkner confirmed that the last three episodes would be linked in one continuous story arc . This was a reflection of Pinkner and fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman 's intent to have the last three episodes of every season seem like you 're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel . And usually in a good novel , the last pages of a chapter compels you forward with a new understanding of what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you cant wait to turn that page . Some media outlets have referred to the episodes as a three-part third-season finale . During a conference call with journalists , actor John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the third season an epic trilogy . He elaborated All year we 've been heading toward the fact that there seems to be an inevitable conflict between the two universes . And we 've gotten to know the people on both sides now , so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with ' 6:02 . ' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate . Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading . And so everyone has to move into another gear and say , ' Okay , this problem is not going to go away . It 's now affecting our side . We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem . ' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy , leading up to the use of that machine . In the same interview , Noble called the episode 's title very critical to the series , stating That time frame plays through the three episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finale , that time frame . In March 2011 , TVline 's Michael Ausiello exclusively confirmed that previous guest actor Kevin Corrigan would be returning for the twentieth and twenty-first episodes of the season . Corrigan last appeared in the season 's twelfth episode Concentrate and Ask Again ; his role in 6:02 AM EST and the following week 's episode The Last Sam Weiss marked his sixth and seventh appearances on ' ' Fringe ' ' , respectively . As with other ' ' Fringe ' ' episodes , Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children , focusing on the science seen in 6:02 AM EST , with the intention of having students learn about weather forecasting . Ironically , the sunny post-daybreak conditions depicted as occurring at the time used as the episode 's title ( 6:02 AM Eastern Standard Time ) can not ever occur anywhere in New York state under the Daylight Saving Time rules used in the contemporary United States . Even on the very first days of the period in the autumn when DST ends and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet risen over any part of the state . The same is true on the last day of Standard Time in the spring ( even in Montauk , Long Island , which is the southeasternmost point of New York , the sunrise on the final day of EST in 2011 was at 6:06 AM ) . A better title for the episode would have thus have been 6:02 AM EDT . # Reception # # Ratings # On its initial broadcast in the United States , the episode was watched by an estimated 3.51 million viewers , with a 1.2/4 ratings share for those aged 1849 . It was seen by 14 percent fewer viewers than the previous week , though several other series airing that night were also down in viewers . The 1.2 ratings share resulted in a series low for ' ' Fringe ' ' . # Reviews # The A.V. Club 's Noel Murray graded the episode with an A- , explaining that though he did not want to give a full review until the season finale aired , he was enjoying how ' ' Fringe ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-cutting between Earth-1 and Earth-2 , and the sense of imminent doom . Murray continued that he especially liked .. that in the midst of all this end-times rush , it pauses periodically to check in with the various characters in short one-on-one scenes , strengthening our sense of what these relationships mean . ( It 's something that ' ' Fringe ' ' has gotten good at in the past year-and-a-half , and something I would n't have predicted for the show back in season one . ) Writing for the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' , critic Andrew Hanson noted ' ' Fringe ' ' is preparing for the finale , calling 6:02 AM EST a movement episode that gives an opportunity to get everyone into place for the big climax in a vein similar to the television series ' ' Lost ' ' . Hanson enjoyed the two sleights of hand , explaining he was surprised by Fauxlivia 's universe-crossing device failing and what happened to Peter after touching the machine . IGN 's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 7.5/10 , writing This week 's episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high marks for character development and putting the pieces in place for a great season finale . Like Hanson , Isler loved the outcome of Peter and the machine , calling it a nice plot twist ; he also praised Blair Brown as one of the many under-appreciated elements of the series . Writing for Mania.com , critic Kurt Anthony Krug acknowledged the episode had a tough act to follow after the previous week 's episode , but stated it 's still pretty good . Sarah Stegall from SFScope was happy to see Peter taking a more active role with the machine plotline , but disliked the episode 's religious elements , believing that Walter 's scene in the church felt forced . Stegall concluded her review noting This episode felt like the first part of a chess game , as the pieces are arranged on the board . The big move is coming up , the endgame that will decide who wins and who loses .
