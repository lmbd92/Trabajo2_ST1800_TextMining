@@692514 birthplace = Erie , Pennsylvania deathplace = Los Angeles , California Harry Kellar ( July 11 , 1849 &amp;ndash ; March 10 , 1922 ) was an American magician who presented large stage shows during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Kellar was a predecessor of Harry Houdini and a successor of Robert Heller . He was often referred to as the Dean of American Magicians and performed extensively on five continents . One of his most memorable stage illusions was the levitation of a girl advertised as the Levitation of Princess Karnack , which was similar to an illusion invented by John Nevil Maskelyne , from which Kellar copied by bribing one of Maskelyne 's theater staff . He was a longtime customer of the Martinka Magic Company , which built many of his illusions and sets , including the Blue Room . # Early life # Like most magicians , there is little of Kellar 's early life that can be confirmed . His real name was Heinrich Keller and he was born to German immigrants in Erie , Pennsylvania . He was sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a child , Kellar loved to play dangerous games and was known to play chicken with passing trains . Kellar apprenticed under a druggist and frequently experimented with various chemical mixtures . On one occasion , Kellar reportedly blew a hole in the floor of his employer 's drugstore . Rather than confront the wrath of his parents , Kellar stowed away on a train and became a vagabond . He was only ten years old at the time . Kellar was befriended by a British-born minister of religion from upstate New York . He offered to adopt Kellar and pay for his education if he would study to also become a minister . One evening Kellar saw the performance of a traveling magician , The Fakir of Ava , the stage name of Isiaiah Harris Hughes , and , after the show , Kellar immediately got the urge to go on the stage . He later told Houdini that , I became very restless , bought books on magic and finally left my friend and benefactor . While working on a farm in Buffalo , New York , Kellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes , who was looking for an assistant . Kellar was hired and , at the age of sixteen , gave his first solo performance in Dunkirk , Michigan ; it was a disaster and Kellar went back to work with Hughes . Two years later , Keller tried again with better results , but , as he was in poor financial condition , his early career often consisted of borrowing equipment for the show and avoiding creditors . # Career # In 1869 , Kellar began working with The Davenport Brothers and Fay , which was a group of stage spirtualists made up of Ira Erastus Davenport , William Henry Davenport and William Fay . Kellar spent several years working with them , until 1873 , when he and Fay parted ways with the Davenports and embarked on a world tour through Central and South America . In Mexico , they were able to make $10,000 ( $ 0 in today 's figures ) . In 1875 , the tour ended in Rio de Janeiro with an appearance before Emperor Dom Pedro II . Then , on their way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sailing on , the ' ' Boyne ' ' , sank in the Bay of Biscay . Lost in the wreckage were Keller 's equipment and clothing , along with the ship 's cargo of gold , silver and uncut diamonds . After the shipwreck , Keller was left with only the clothes on his back and a diamond ring he was wearing . Afterwards , his bankers in New York cabled him telling him that his bank had failed . Desperate for money , Kellar sold his ring and parted ways with Fay , who left to rejoin the Davenports . After visiting John Nevil Maskelyne 's and George Alfred Cooke 's theater , called the Egyptian Hall , Keller was inspired and liked the idea of performing in one spot . He loved the illusions Maskelyne and Cook performed but it was Buatier de Kolta , then playing there , who performed ' The Vanishing Birdcage ' , a trick that Kellar decided he must have and spent his remaining money to buy it from him . Kellar borrowed $500 from Junius Spencer Morgan ( father of J.P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to retrieve his funds from a bank transaction he had initiated when he was in Brazil . Knowing that mail from Brazil was slow , he was able to recover all of the $3,500 . With the money , Kellar started a troupe based on Masekylne 's and Cooke 's in England , even going so far as naming his theater the Egyptian Hall . In 1878 , Kellar returned to England and invested $12,000 into purchasing new equipment , including a version Maskelyne 's whist-playing automaton Psycho . After a disappointing tour in South America , Kellar cancelled his remaining shows and returned to New York . Shortly before arriving , Kellar was told of the death of magician Robert Heller . ' ' The New York Sun ' ' accused Kellar of pirating Heller 's name , saying that Heller is scarcely dead before we read of ' Kellar the Wizard ' . The article goes on to say , Of course ' Kellar ' aims to profit by the reputation that Heller left , by adopting a close imitation of Heller 's name . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name had always been Keller with an e and that he had actually changed it years previously to try to avoid being confused with Heller . He also pointed out that Heller had changed his name from William Henry Palmer . The public was still unreceptive to him , causing Kellar to eventually cancel his upcoming shows in the United States and return to Brazil . After another world tour in 1882 , Kellar was performing again in Melbourne , Australia and met a fan , Eva Lydia Medley , who came backstage to get his autograph . Kellar promised to send postcards and letters from his travels . They exchanged letters for the next five years . Kellar started his version of Egyptian Hall in December 1884 , after renting out an old Masonic temple on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . After 264 performances , Kellar closed the theater on June 24 , 1885 . Shortly after Kellar left , the theater burned down . While Kellar was performing in America , Medley arrived a few weeks before his appearance in Erie , Pennsylvania . She played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magic business . Kellar and Medley were married on November 1 , 1887 at a church in Kalamazoo , Michigan . She played an important role in Kellar 's shows in the coming years not only did she play a part in many of his upcoming illusions , but she also provided music for the shows . Kellar returned to Philadelphia in October 1891 and opened his second Egyptian Hall at Concert Hall , located also on Chestnut Street . On April 30 , 1892 , Kellar ended a successful seven month run at his second Egyptian Hall . Kellar then returned to the road . During the periods Kellar was abroad , another magician , Alexander Herrmann , had become famous and Kellar found himself with a rival on his return to the United States . Herrmann often criticized Kellar 's lack of sleight of hand and claimed he preferred to use mechanical tricks instead . While he lacked sleight of hand , Kellar was so good in using misdirection , that he said a ... brass band playing at full blast can march openly across the stage behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one will realize that they went by . Herrmann died on December 17 , 1896. # Later life # Kellar retired in 1908 , and allowed Howard Thurston to be his successor . Kellar had met Thurston , who was doing card tricks , while on vacation in Paris , France . Kellar did his final show at Ford 's Theatre in Baltimore , Maryland . Kellar eventually moved to his house in Los Angeles , California . Kellar 's wife died two years later . Kellar was often visited by other magicians , notably including Harry Houdini . On November 11 , 1917 , Houdini put together a show for the Society of American Magicians to benefit the families of those who died in the sinking of the USS ' ' Antilles ' ' by a German U-boat ( who have been considered the first American casualties of World War I ) . Houdini got Kellar to come out of retirement to perform one more show . The show took place on the largest stage at the time , the Hippodrome . After Kellar 's performance , Kellar started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americas greatest magician should be carried off in triumph after his final public performance . The members of the Society of American Magicians helped Kellar into the seat of a sedan chair , and lifted it up . The 125-piece Hippodrome orchestra played Auld Lang Syne while Kellar was slowly taken away . Kellar lived in retirement , until he died on March 3 , 1922 from a pulmonary hemorrhage brought on by influenza . He was interred in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles . # Notable illusions # # The Levitation of Princess Karnac # Kellar supposedly developed this trick by abruptly walking onto the stage during a show by Maskelyne , seeing what he needed to know , and leaving . Unable to duplicate it , Kellar hired another magician to help build another , but eventually designed a new trick with the help of the Otis Elevator Company . Another version built by Kellar was purchased by Harry Blackstone , Sr. , who used the trick for many years . The Buffalo writer John Northern Hilliard wrote that the levitation was a marvel of the twentieth century and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . # The Nested Boxes # Kellar borrows six finger rings from members of audience . He loads them into the barrel of a pistol , aims and fires the pistol at a chest that is hanging on the side of the stage . The chest is opened and inside is another , smaller chest . Inside that , are six boxes nested in each other . As each is opened , they are stacked on top of each other and inside the smallest one are the five rings each tied with ribbon to flowers . The five rings are returned to their owners . The owner of the sixth ring wonders what happened to hers , with Kellar pretending not to notice . He continues with his next trick , which a variation of Robert-Houdin 's Inexhaustible Bottle . Audience members call out different beverages like wine , whiskey , lemonade , or just water . Each one is poured from the same bottle and the audience acknowledges that they are indeed receiving their requested drinks . Once bottle is empty , Kellar takes it and breaks it open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its neck which has the sixth ring attached to it . The ring is eventually handed back to its owner . A variation of the trick was performed in front of United States President Theodore Roosevelt and his children , Ethel , Archie , Quentin and Kermit . Ethel was the owner of the sixth ring and after Kellar had returned her ring , he asked if she would also like to have the guinea pig as a pet . Then Kellar wrapped the guinea pig in paper and handed it back to Ethel . When it was opened , inside was a bouquet of pink roses . # The Vanishing Lamp # A lamp is seen set on top of a glass table . Still lit , Kellar covers the lamp with a thin cloth . Kellar told the audience that each evening , the lamp would be returned to its purported , original owner in India at a specific time . As a bell sounded out the current time of day , Kellar loaded a pistol and aimed it towards the lamp . At the last chime , Kellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the cloth falling to the stage . Kellar was known to have a short temper , and once , after an incident in which the Vanishing Lamp failed to vanish , he took an axe to the defective prop . Later Kellar built another one that would continue to work reliably long after his retirement . # Footnotes
