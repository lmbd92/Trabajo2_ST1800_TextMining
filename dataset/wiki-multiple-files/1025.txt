@@5488514 coordinates = North Medford High School is a public high school in Medford , Oregon , United States . It is part of Medford School District ( Oregon ) # History # Originally the City of Medford had a single high school , called Medford High School , constructed in the 1920s . In the 1960s , the school district expanded , constructing a new high school on the opposite side of the city . Rather than develop this into an independent school , the district kept Medford High School as the lone school , with students attending at the two different locations . The current campus of NMHS was the newly constructed Medford Senior High School , with grades 11 and 12 attending while grades 9 and 10 went to Medford Mid High School , which later became South Medford High School ( SMHS ) and ultimately Central Medford High School . ( SMHS has since changed locations following construction of a new school ) . This was set in place to primarily to allow Medford to compete athletically with larger school districts such as Portland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic ( then 2A ) divisions if the district would have been divided into two secondary schools .
