Pinch-hitter Esteban Germn was the next batter . Rzepczynski struck him out as well . In the ninth , closer Jason Motte pitched an easy 123 inning to give St. Louis the win . Controversy surrounded the inning , as Adrin Beltr was the victim of a blown call . Beltr grounded a ball to third , and Descalso threw the ball to first for the out , but replays showed he fouled the ball off his foot . # Game 2 # Thursday , October 20 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis , Missouri Game 2 saw a pitchers ' duel between Jaime Garca and Colby Lewis . Both starters kept the game scoreless through the first six innings .

Andrus singled into center field , and moved to second on the throw home , which got by Albert Pujols for an error . With runners on second and third , and none out , Tony La Russa switched in Arthur Rhodes for Motte . Consecutive sacrifice flies from Josh Hamilton and Michael Young gave Texas the lead . Neftal Feliz came on in the ninth , and allowed a leadoff walk to Yadier Molina , but retired the next three batters in order to end the game and tie the Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , October 22 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington , Texas After a total of just eight runs scored in the first two games in St. Louis , the offense of the two lineups scored a combined 23 runs on a historic night in Arlington in which Albert Pujols had what was described as the greatest individual hitting performance in World Series history . Allen Craig hit a home run in the first to put the Cardinals up 10 . They scored four more runs in the fourth after a controversial call at first base by umpire Ron Kulpa and a run-producing error by Mike Napoli , but the Rangers came back in the bottom frame : Michael Young and Nelson Cruz hit home runs to make it 53 . But in the next inning the Cardinals added three more runs including what became the game-winning two-RBI double by Yadier Molina making the score 83 . The Rangers answered with three runs in the bottom half of the inning to make it a two-run game again . Albert Pujols , who had been hitless through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home run off Alexi Ogando in the sixth inning to drive in three runs . He homered two more times later and drove in six runs in total on the night . The Cardinals went on to win the game by a score of 167 , leading the Series by 21 . Albert Pujols joined Babe Ruth ( 1926 , 1928 ) and Reggie Jackson ( 1977 ) as the only players in baseball history up to that time to hit three home runs in a World Series game . ( Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year . ) Pujols was 5-for-6 with two singles , three HRs , four runs scored , and six RBIs . Yadier Molina added two doubles , driving in four runs . David Freese continued his postseason 13-game hitting streak getting two hits ( one double ) , driving in two runs . Pujols became the first player in World Series history to get hits in four consecutive innings : fourth ( single ) , fifth ( single ) , sixth ( HR , three RBIs ) , and seventh ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most HRs ( 3 ) , most hits ( 5 ) , and most RBIs ( 6 ) in a World Series game , and established a new record with 14 total bases . The 16 runs scored by the Cardinals were the most runs scored in a World Series game since 2002 , when the San Francisco Giants scored 16 against the Anaheim Angels . The current record is 18 by the New York Yankees against the New York Giants in 1936. # Game 4 # Sunday , October 23 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington , Texas After a high scoring affair the night before , Derek Holland quieted the Cardinals ' bats as he pitched innings of two-hit baseball . Lance Berkman had both of the Cardinals ' two hits . Josh Hamilton 's first-inning RBI double put the Rangers in front for only the second time in the Series . A three-run home run by Mike Napoli provided Holland a comfortable 40 lead . The Cardinals managed a small rally in the ninth , but were unable to score against closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington , Texas Game 1 starters C. J. Wilson and Chris Carpenter faced off again . Wilson walked two batters , Matt Holliday and Lance Berkman , in the second inning and both came in to score , aided in part by an error by David Murphy . However , despite the Rangers walking nine batters in the game ( including Albert Pujols three times intentionally ) , the Cardinals had not scored again , leaving twelve runners on base . Mitch Moreland hit a solo home run in the third , and Adrin Beltr also hit one in the sixth , to tie the score at 22 . The Rangers ' half of the eighth featured a series of bullpen mix-ups by the Cardinals , leaving Tony La Russa without closer Jason Motte in a crucial situation . After Michael Young led off the inning with a double , La Russa sent both Motte ( a right-hander ) and left-handed reliever Marc Rzepczynski to begin warmups . However , Cardinals bullpen coach Derek Lilliquist later stated that he only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Motte was not warming up , he made a second call to the bullpen , but this time Lilliquist thought he heard La Russa called for reliever Lance Lynn , who was supposedly unavailable for the game due to throwing 47 pitches in Game 3 . Dotel intentionally walked Nelson Cruz , whereupon La Russa summoned Rzepczynski to face the left-handed hitting Murphy . Usually , the Rangers would counter with a right-handed pinch-hitter , such as Craig Gentry or Yorvit Torrealba . However , Murphy stayed in the game , and hit a grounder off Rzepczynski , loading the bases . With Motte not yet available ( La Russa thought he was warming up , but he was not yet ready ) , La Russa was forced to match Rzepczynski against the right-handed hitting Mike Napoli , who hit a two-run double scoring Young and Cruz . After a Moreland strikeout , La Russa summoned for Motte from the bullpen , only to be surprised to see Lynn coming out ( it was then when he learned of the mix-ups ) . Lynn then was asked to intentionally walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Series history to make a relief appearance solely to serve an intentional walk . Neftal Feliz came in to save the game in the ninth , his second save of the Series . # Game 6 # Thursday , October 27 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis , Missouri Game 6 was a rematch of Game 2 's starters : Cardinals lefty Jaime Garca and Rangers starter Colby Lewis . Texas jumped on top immediately , with Josh Hamilton driving in Ian Kinsler in the top of the first . The Cardinals responded quickly with a two-run Lance Berkman home run in the bottom half . Kinsler tied the game in the top of the second with a ground-rule double , scoring Craig Gentry . Garca was pulled after only three innings ( and 59 pitches ) and replaced with Fernando Salas . Leading off the top of the fourth , Matt Holliday misplayed a Nelson Cruz pop fly , putting Cruz at second . Mike Napoli singled him home to once again give Texas the lead . The Cardinals jumped right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error and scoring on a Yadier Molina groundout to knot the game at three . David Freese started off the top of the fifth by dropping a routine pop fly ( the third consecutive half-inning to begin with an error ) , which immediately turned into the go-ahead run for Texas on Young 's double . Colby Lewis was cruising for the Rangers until the bottom of the sixth . After an Albert Pujols strikeout , Berkman singled to third . Matt Holliday grounded into a possible double play which was mishandled at first by Michael Young ( his second error of the game ) , leaving all runners safe . Lewis walked the bases loaded and was pulled for Alexi Ogando , who promptly walked Yadier Molina to force in a run . With the Cardinals in a prime position to rally ahead , Matt Holliday , standing 90 ft away as the possible go-ahead run , was picked off at third by catcher Mike Napoli . Holliday injured his finger sliding in on the play and was forced to leave the game . The Rangers were able to slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lance Lynn came on to pitch for the Cardinals in the top of the seventh and was promptly greeted with back-to-back home runs by Adrin Beltr and Nelson Cruz to put Texas up by two . Ian Kinsler added his second RBI later in the inning to make the score 74 Rangers . In the bottom of the eighth , Allen Craig ( who entered the game as Holliday 's replacement ) hit a solo home run to pull the Cardinals within two . Rangers closer Neftal Feliz entered in the bottom of the ninth to deliver the Rangers their first ever World Series Championship . After striking out Ryan Theriot , Feliz faced Albert Pujols . Facing possibly his last at-bat as a Cardinal , Pujols hit Feliz 's first pitch into left field for a double . Feliz walked Lance Berkman to put the tying run on first , but got Craig to take a called third strike . The Rangers were one out away from a championship as David Freese stepped to the plate . Down in the count 12 , Freese hit Feliz 's pitch past a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying the game at seven in dramatic fashion . Sent into extra innings , the Rangers ' MVP candidate Josh Hamilton put Texas up again with a towering two-run home run . Down 97 , the Cardinals once again faced only three outs until elimination . St. Louis manufactured a run to make it 98 , and following an intentional Albert Pujols walk Lance Berkman was at the dish . Berkman worked the count to 22 , again the Rangers were one strike away from their first championship . Berkman took Scott Feldman 's next pitch into center field for a single , scoring Jon Jay and tying the game once again . It was the first time in World Series history that a team came back from two different two-run deficits in the ninth inning or later in the same game . The Rangers failed to score in the top of the 11th , bringing David Freese to lead off the bottom of the inning . Freese hit Mark Lowe 's 32 pitch into the center field grass for a game-winning home run , forcing the World Series to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 13 instances in which a Major League team won a Game 6 at home to force a Game 7 in the postseason , all but one went on to win Game 7 . The exception was the New York Mets in the 2006 NLCS , against , incidentally , the Cardinals . Freese 's walk-off home run was only the fourth in a Game 6 in World Series history . The Cardinals set two milestones in their Game 6 winthe first team to come back from deficits in both the 9th and 10th innings , and the first team to score in the 8th , 9th , 10th , and 11th innings . On ' ' Mike and Mike in the Morning ' ' the next day , ESPN senior baseball analyst Buster Olney called it the greatest game in the history of baseball .

David Freese and Lance Berkman became the third and fourth players in World Series history to get game-tying hits with their team one out from elimination . Freese , who grew up a Cardinal fan in the suburbs of St. Louis , said that as he was circling the bases after his home run , he was thinking about a similar walk-off homer by Jim Edmonds for the Cardinals in Game 6 of the 2004 National League Championship Series . After Freese said he remembered that home run , Lance Berkman , who played for the losing Houston Astros in that series , said So do I . # Game 7 # Friday , October 28 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis , Missouri Before Game 7 , the Cardinals replaced Matt Holliday , who sprained his wrist in Game 6 , on their roster with Adron Chambers .

Wilson came on to relieve Feldman and promptly hit Rafael Furcal with his first pitch , forcing in another run to make it 52 . In the seventh inning , Lance Berkman scored on a Molina single to make it 62 . Chris Carpenter was relieved after pitching six innings and was credited with the win . The Cardinals used four relievers to hold Texas scoreless over the final three innings .
