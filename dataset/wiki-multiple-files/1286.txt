An orderly wheels Marta 's body into a morgue drawer , past a mourning couple , who a nurse gives a crucifix necklace . The orderly overhears two workers autopsying a pair of male bodies , looks in on them out of curiosity , and leaves when one of the morticians ( who is disturbingly enthused by his duties ) glares at him . The morticians complete their work on the dead men , and while one leaves , the other remains , and brings in Marta 's body . Aroused by Marta , the mortician locks himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain , and caresses it with a knife , which he uses to mutilate Marta 's vagina , and cut open her torso . The mortician masturbates to orgasm while fondling Marta 's breasts and innards , then takes photographs of his handiwork . Unable to contain his lust any longer , the mortician engages in necrophilia , after setting his camera on automatic to record the event . Afterward , the mortician autopsies Marta , cleans up , and leaves . In his home , the pajama-clad mortician blends Marta 's stolen heart into a pulp , which he gives to his dog before proceeding to relax in his sitting room . As a baby 's cries emanate from the television , the scraps of newspaper the dog is eating the heart off of are shown to contain Marta 's obituary . # Cast # * Pep Tosar as Forense * Jordi Tarrida as Mdico #2 * ngel Tarris as Celador * Xevi Collellmir as Cadver Vin # Reception # Dread Central wrote , It is intense . It is unflinching . Yet , at its core it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detail and composition as any other great film has ever been , while The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre stated that ' ' Aftermath ' ' is a beautifully shot sick movie with an ending that is as subtle as it is thought-provoking and raises this whole sickening work into the single most gut-wrenching and extreme expression of irony ever made . DVD Talk awarded four and a half out of five stars and wrote , The necrophilia in this movie is very disturbing . It is not just carnal ; it is filled with volatility and extreme violence . While nothing is shown outright , the implication is repellent enough . Indeed , one could argue that Cerd is making a larger point about defying death . But it 's a hard sell . Treating the departed as nothing more than a plaything for the fulfillment of one 's most twisted desires almost erases any grander theme . While the ending is quite unnerving , the rest of ' ' Aftermath ' ' is an equally uneasy ordeal . You may see nothing more in it than fetishism gone foul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloody Disgusting rated it four and half out of five stars and wrote , Aftermath , is definitely one of the most controversial films of the last couple of decades . Its ruthless and realistic depiction of grisly autopsies and a sinister surgeon with an inclination towards violent necrophilia has some of the hardest scenes to stomach in any horror movie , period . # Awards # ' ' Aftermath ' ' won in the category Best Short Film at the 1997 Fantasia Festival . # References #
