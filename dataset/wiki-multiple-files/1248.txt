@@7245514 Leonard Solomon Lerman ( June 27 , 1925 - September 19 , 2012 ) was an American scientist most noted for his work on DNA . # Life and career # Lerman was born and raised in Pittsburgh , the son of Freamah and Meyer Lerman , Jewish immigrants from Russia . His father was a department store buyer . Lerman began attending the Carnegie Institute of Technology before graduating from high school and received his BS in five semesters . As a graduate student with Linus Pauling at the California Institute of Technology , Lerman discovered that antibodies have two binding sites . Later , perhaps his most important discovery was that certain molecules bind to DNA by intercalation . This discovery has shaped much of science 's understanding about how drugs and mutagens interact with DNA . Later , during a sabbatical at the University of Cambridge , Lerman had a chance to work with later Nobel prize winners Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick . Lerman led a productive research program at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Albany . Lerman 's lab crew included at least one Nobel prize winner , Sidney Altman , and another , Tom Maniatis , who also became one of the leading molecular biologists of his time . Lerman 's last major effort , begun with Stuart Fischer at SUNY , was the invention of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) , a technique used to separate DNA molecules . DGGE is widely used by scientists who wish to ascertain biodiversity in microbial communities . Dr. Lerman was also a senior member of one of the first biotechnology companies , the Genetics Institute . Dr. Lerman was a member of the National Academy of Sciences , USA. # References #
