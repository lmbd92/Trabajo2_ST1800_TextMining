It is an irritant and toxic , as are all soluble barium compounds . It is sometimes used in pyrotechnics to produce a green color . It also finds use in the production of chloric acid . # Reactions # Synthesis Barium chlorate can be produced through a double replacement reaction between solutions of barium chloride and sodium chlorate : : BaCl <sub> 2 </sub> + 2 NaClO <sub> 3 </sub> Ba ( ClO <sub> 3 </sub> ) <sub> 2 </sub> + 2 NaCl On concentrating and chilling the resulting mixture , barium chlorate precipitates . This is perhaps the most common preparation , exploiting the lower solubility of barium chlorate compared to sodium chlorate . The above method does result in some sodium contamination , which is undesirable for pyrotechnic purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green of barium . Sodium-free barium chlorate can be produced directly through electrolysis : : BaCl <sub> 2 </sub> + 6 H <sub> 2 </sub> O Ba ( ClO <sub> 3 </sub> ) <sub> 2 </sub> + 6 H <sub> 2 </sub> It can also be produced by the reaction of barium carbonate with boiling ammonium chlorate solution : : 2 NH <sub> 4 </sub> ClO <sub> 3 </sub> + BaCO <sub> 3 </sub> + ' ' Q ' ' Ba ( ClO <sub> 3 </sub> ) <sub> 2 </sub> + 2 NH <sub> 3 </sub> + H <sub> 2 </sub> O + CO <sub> 2 </sub> The reaction initially produces barium chlorate and ammonium carbonate ; boiling the solution decomposes the ammonium carbonate and drives off the resulting ammonia and carbon dioxide , leaving only barium chlorate in solution . Decomposition When exposed to heat , barium chlorate alone will decompose to barium chloride and oxygen : : Ba ( ClO <sub> 3 </sub> ) <sub> 2 </sub> BaCl <sub> 2 </sub> + 3O <sub> 2 </sub> Chloric acid Barium chlorate is used to produce chloric acid , the formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilute sulfuric acid , which results in a solution of chloric acid and insoluble barium sulfate precipitate : : Ba ( ClO <sub> 3 </sub> ) <sub> 2 </sub> + H <sub> 2 </sub> SO <sub> 4 </sub> 2HClO <sub> 3 </sub> + BaSO <sub> 4 </sub> Both the chlorate and the acid should be prepared as dilute solutions before mixing , such that the chloric acid produced is dilute , as concentrated solutions of chloric acid ( above 30% ) are unstable and prone to decompose , sometimes explosively . # Commercial Uses # Fireworks Barium Chlorate , when burned with a fuel , produces a vibrant green light . Because it is an oxidizer , a chlorine donor , and contains a metal , this compound produces a green color that is unparalleled . However , due to the instability of all chlorates to sulfur , acids , and ammonium ions , chlorates have been banned from use in class C fireworks in the United States . Therefore , more and more firework producers have begun to use more stable compound such as barium nitrate and copper carbonate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can also harm the environment . It is very harmful to aquatic organisms if it is leached into bodies of water . Chemical spills of this compound , although not common , can harm entire ecosystems and should be prevented . It is necessary to dispose of this compound as hazardous waste . The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) lists barium chlorate as hazardous .
