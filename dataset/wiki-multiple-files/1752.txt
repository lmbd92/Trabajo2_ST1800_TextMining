Two parts of the field are in production , Sleipner West ( proven in 1974 ) , and Sleipner East ( 1981 ) . The field produces natural gas and light oil condensates from sandstone structures about 2500 m below sea level . It is operated by Statoil . The field is named after the steed Sleipnir in Norse mythology . # Reserves and production # As of the end of 2005 , the estimated recoverable reserves for the Sleipner West and East fields were 51.6 billion cubic metres of natural gas , 4.4 million tonnes of natural gas liquids , and 3.9 million cubic metres of condensates . Daily production of the field in 2008 was equivalents , 36 million cubic metres of natural gas per day , and 14,000 cubic metres of condensate per day . Sleipner field consists of four platforms . The Sleipner A platform is located on the Sleipner East and the Sleipner B platform is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely from the Sleipner A via an umbilical cable . The Sleipner T carbon dioxide treatment platform is linked physically to the Sleipner A platform by a bridge and to the Sleipner B wellhead platform by 12.5 km carbon dioxide flow line . The Sleipner Riser platform , serving the Langeled and Zeepipe pipelines , is located on the Sleipner East field . # Carbon capture and storage project # The Sleipner West field is used as facility for carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) . It is the world 's first offshore CCS plant , operative since October 1996 . Carbon dioxide is treated on the Sleipner T treatment platform . After that carbon dioxide is transported by flow line to the Sleipner B wellhead platform where it is injected to the reservoir . Norwegian natural gas pipelines ' operator Gassco has proposed to build a 240 km carbon dioxide pipeline from Krst to transport carbon dioxide from the Krst power station .
