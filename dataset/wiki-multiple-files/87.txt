He often portrayed impoverished ' ' campesinos ' ' or a peasant of ' ' pelado ' ' origin . The character came to be associated with the national identity of Mexico , and allowed Cantinflas to establish a long , successful film career that included a foray into Hollywood . Charlie Chaplin once commented that he was the best comedian alive , and Moreno has been referred to as the Charlie Chaplin of Mexico . To audiences in the United States , he is best remembered as co-starring with David Niven in a Golden Globe Award-winning role in the 1956 film ' ' Around the World in 80 Days ' ' .

He was one of the children born to Pedro Moreno Esquivel , an impoverished mail carrier , and Mara de la Soledad Reyes Guzar ( from Cotija , Michoacan ) . They had eight children : Pedro , Jos ( Pepe ) , Eduardo , Fortino , Esperanza , Catalina , Enrique , and Roberto . He made it through difficult situations with the quick wit and street smarts that he would later apply in his films . His comic personality led him to a circus tent show , and from there to legitimate theatre and film . He married Valentina Ivanova Zubareff , of Russian ethnicity , on October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in January 1966 . A son was born to Moreno in 1961 by another woman ; the child was adopted by Valentina Ivanova and was named Mario Arturo Moreno Ivanova , causing some references to erroneously refer to him as Cantinflas ' adopted son . He served as president of the Mexican actor 's trade union In 1993 , after his death in Mexico City of lung cancer , thousands appeared on the rainy day for his funeral . The ceremony was a national event , lasting three days . His body lay in state in the ' ' Rotonda de Las Personas Ilustres ' ' ( The Rotunda of Illustrious Persons , formerly known as Rotunda of Illustrious men ) and he was honored by many heads of state and the United States Senate , which held a moment of silence for him .

Moreno Laparade won the lawsuit twice , but Moreno Ivanova eventually triumphed after two appeals . In 2005 , Mario Moreno Ivanova , Jr . won rights to 39 films and name . At the same time , another legal battle ensued between Columbia Pictures and Moreno Ivanova over control of these films . Columbia claims that it bought the rights to the 34 films four decades ago with the court noting several discrepancies in the papers . Moreno Ivanova wanted the rights to the films to remain his and more generally , Mexico 's , as a national treasure . On June 2 , 2001 the eight-year battle was resolved with Columbia retaining ownership over the 34 disputed films . # Origin of name # As a young man , Cantinflas performed a variety of acts in travelling tents , and it was here that he acquired the nickname Cantinflas , although the origin of the name is obscured by legend . According to one obituary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents from knowing he was in the entertainment business , which they considered a shameful occupation . In another version , the Mexican media critic and theorist Carlos Monsivis cites a legendary account of the origin of Cantinflas ' characteristic speech : # Entertainment career # Before starting his professional life in entertainment , he explored a number of possible careers , such as medicine and professional boxing , before joining the entertainment world as a dancer . By 1930 he was involved in Mexico City 's ' ' carpa ' ' ( travelling tent ) circuit , performing in succession with the Ofelia , Sotelo of Azcapotzalco , and finally the Valentina ' ' carpa ' ' , where he met his future wife . At first he tried to imitate Al Jolson by smearing his face with black paint , but later separated himself to form his own identity as an impoverished slum dweller with baggy pants , a rope for a belt , and a distinctive mustache . In the tents , he danced , performed acrobatics , and performed roles related to several different professions . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and producer Santiago Reachi and subsequently partnered with him to form their own film production venture . Reachi produced , directed , and distributed , while Cantinflas acted . Cantinflas made his film debut in 1936 with ' ' No te engaes corazn ' ' before meeting Reachi , but the film received little attention . Reachi established Posa Films in 1939 with two partners : Cantinflas and Fernandez . Before this , Reachi producedshort films that allowed him to develop the Cantinflas character , but it was in 1940 that he finally became a movie star , after shooting ' ' Ah est el detalle ' ' ( There 's the rub , literally There lies the detail ) , with Sofa lvarez , Joaqun Pardav , Sara Garca , and Dolores Camarillo . The phrase that gave that movie its name became a Cantinflas ( or catchphrase ) for the remainder of his career . The film was a breakthrough in Latin America and was later recognized by ' ' Somos ' ' magazine as the 10th greatest film produced largely in Mexico .

By this time , he had sufficiently distinguished the ' ' peladito ' ' character from the 1920s-era ' ' pelado ' ' , and his character flowed comfortably from the disenfranchised , marginalized , underclassman to the empowered public servant . The rhetoric of ' ' cantinflismo ' ' facilitated this fluidity . He would reprise the role of Agent 777 and be honored by police forces throughout Latin America for his positive portrayal of law enforcement . ' ' Ni sangre , ni arena ' ' ( Neither Blood , nor Sand a play on words on the bullfighter/gladiator phrase ' ' Blood and Sand ( 1941 film ) The 1940s and 1950s were Cantinflas ' heyday . In 1941 , he rejected Mexican film companies and instead signed with Columbia Pictures .

Critics , including the PAN and archbishop Luis Mara Martnez , called the mural blasphemous , and it was eventually painted without the image of the Virgin . ' ' Yo Coln ' ' placed Cantinflas in the character of Christopher Columbus , who , while continually discovering America , made comical historical and contemporary observations from fresh perspectives . The jokes changed nightly , and Moreno continued to employ his word games and double entendres to jab at politicians . In 1956 , ' ' Around the World in Eighty Days ' ' , Cantinflas ' American debut , earned him a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a musical or comedy .

While David Niven was billed as the lead in English-speaking nations , Cantinflas was billed as the lead elsewhere . As a result of the film , Cantinflas became the world 's best paid actor . Moreno 's second Hollywood feature , ' ' Pepe ' ' , attempted to replicate the success of his first . The film had cameo appearances by Frank Sinatra , Judy Garland and other stars . His humor , deeply rooted in the Spanish language , did not translate well for the American audience and the movie was a notorious box office disappointment . He still earned a Golden Globe nomination for his part . Later in a 1992 American interview , Moreno cited the language barrier as the biggest impediment to his making it big in the United States . After returning to Mexico , Cantinflas starred in the comic drama ' ' El bolero de Raquel ' ' ( 1957 ) , the first Cantinflas film to be distributed to the United States by Columbia Pictures . The film was followed by three more **27;27972;TOOLONG productions : ' ' El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padrecito ' ' ( 1964 ) , and ' ' Su excelencia ' ' ( 1967 ) . After ' ' Su excelencia ' ' , Cantinflas began to appear in a series of low-budget comedies ( also directed by Miguel M. Delgado ) , which were produced by his own company Cantinflas Films . These films lasted until ' ' El Barrendero ' ' , in 1982 . Like Charlie Chaplin , Cantinflas was a social satirist . He played ' ' el pelado ' ' , an impoverished Everyman , with hopes to succeed . With mutual admiration , Cantinflas was influenced by Chaplin 's earlier films and ideology . ' ' El Circo ' ' ( the circus ) was a shadow of Chaplin 's silent film , ' ' The Circus ' ' and ' ' Si yo fuera diputado ' ' ( If I Were a Congressman ) had many similarities with the 1940 film , ' ' The Great Dictator ' ' .

The Cantinflas character was particularly adept at obfuscating the conversation when he owed somebody money , was courting an attractive young woman , or was trying to talk his way out of trouble with authorities , whom he managed to humiliate without their even being able to tell . This manner of talking became known as ' ' Cantinflada ' ' , and it became common parlance for Spanish speakers to say ' ' ests cantinfleando ! ' ' ( loosely translated as you 're pulling a Cantinflas ! or you 're Cantinflassing ! ) whenever someone became hard to understand in conversation .

In the visual arts , Mexican artists such as Rufino Tamayo and Diego Rivera painted Cantinflas as a symbol of the Mexican everyman . The American electronic dance music band Mindless Self Indulgence released a song about Cantinflas called Whipstickagostop . Cantinflas ' style and the content of his films have led scholars to conclude that he influenced the many ' ' teatros ' ' that spread the message of the Chicano Movement during the 1960s-1970s in the United States , the most important of which was El Teatro Campesino . The ' ' teatro ' ' movement was an important part of the cultural renaissance that was the social counterpart of the political movement for the civil rights of Mexican Americans . Cantinflas ' use of social themes and style is seen as a precursor to Chicano theater . A cartoon series , the ' ' Cantinflas Show ' ' , was made in 1972 starring an animated Cantinflas .

The second animated series animated in 1979 and dubbed in English in 1982 was a joint venture between Televisa and Hanna-Barbera and Mario Morenos voiced Little Amigo /Cantinflas in the Spanish version and Don Messick voiced Little Amigo and John Stephenson as the narrator in the English version .

The Mindless Self Indulgence song Whipstickagostop has the lyrics Cantinflas was a body rocker in it . # Critical response # Cantinflas is sometimes seen as a Mexican Groucho Marx character , one who uses his skill with words to puncture the pretensions of the wealthy and powerful , the police and the government . Historian and author of ' ' Cantinflas and the Chaos of Mexican Modernity ' ' , writes , Cantinflas symbolized the underdog who triumphed through trickery over more powerful opponents and presents Cantinflas as a self-image of a transitional Mexico .

Particularly in the film ' ' El analfabeto ' ' , ( ' ' The Illiterate ' ' ) , Cantinflas is the illiterate who takes control of the language by whatever means he can . The journalist Salvador Novo interprets the role of Moreno 's character entirely in terms of ' ' Cantinflismo ' ' : ' ' En condensarlos : en entregar a la saludable carcajada del pueblo la esencia demaggica de su vacuo confusionismo , estriba el mrito y se asegura la gloria de este hijo cazurro de la ciudad ladina y burlona de Mxico , que es ' Cantinflas .
