@@26068514 Leo V is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy situated in the Leo constellation and discovered in 2007 in the data obtained by Sloan Digital Sky Survey . The galaxy is located at the distance of about 180 kpc from the Sun and moves away from the Sun with the velocity of about 173 km/s . It is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dSph ) meaning that it has an approximately spherical shape with the half-light radius of about 130 pc . Leo V is one of the smallest and fainest satellites of the Milky Wayits integrated luminosity is about 10,000 times that of the Sun ( absolute visible magnitude of about ) , and the half-light radius of 40 pc. name=n1group=note which is much lower than the luminosity of a typical globular cluster . However , its mass is about 330 thousands solar masses , which means that Leo 's V mass to light ratio is around 75 . A relatively high mass to light ratio implies that Leo V is dominated by dark matter . The stellar population of Leo V consists mainly of old stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these stars is also very low at , which means that they contain 100 times less heavy elements than the Sun . The galaxy is located only 3 degrees away from another Milky Way 's satellite , Leo IV . The latter is also closer to the Sun by 20 kpc . These two galaxies may be physically associated with each other . There is evidence that they are connected by a star bridge . # Notes #
