@@36345514 In molecular biology , the PsbZ ( Ycf9 ) is a protein domain , which is low in molecular weight . It is a transmembrane protein and therefore is located in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in cyanobacteria and plants . More specifically , it is located in Photosystem II ( PSII ) and in the light-harvesting complex II ( LHCII ) . Ycf9 acts as a structural linker , that stabilises the PSII-LHCII supercomplexes . Moreover , the supercomplex fails to form in PsbZ-deficient mutants , providing further evidence to suggest Ycf9 's role as a structural linker . This may be caused by a marked decrease in two LHCII antenna proteins , CP26 and CP29 , found in PsbZ-deficient mutants , which result in structural changes , as well as functional modifications in PSII. # Function # PSII is a multisubunit protein-pigment complex containing polypeptides bound to the photosynthetic membrane . Within the core of the complex , the chlorophyll and beta-carotene pigments are mainly bound to the antenna proteins CP43 ( PsbC ) and CP47 ( PsbB ) , which pass the excitation energy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and D2 ( Qa , PsbD ) that bind all the redox-active cofactors involved in the energy conversion process . The PSII oxygen-evolving complex ( OEC ) oxidises water to provide protons for use by PSI , and consists of OEE1 ( PsbO ) , OEE2 ( PsbP ) and OEE3 ( PsbQ ) . The remaining subunits in PSII are of low molecular weight ( less than 10 kDa ) , and are involved in PSII assembly , stabilisation , dimerisation , and photo-protection . PsbZ may also be involved in photo-protective processes under sub-optimal growth conditions . # Photosynthesis # Oxygenic photosynthesis uses two multi-subunit photosystems ( I and II ) located in the cell membranes of cyanobacteria and in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in plants and algae . Photosystem II ( PSII ) has a P680 reaction centre containing chlorophyll ' a ' that uses light energy to carry out the oxidation ( splitting ) of water molecules , and to produce ATP via a proton pump . Photosystem I ( PSI ) has a P700 reaction centre containing chlorophyll that takes the electron and associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both ATP and NADPH are subsequently used in the light-independent reactions to convert carbon dioxide to glucose using the hydrogen atom extracted from water by PSII , releasing oxygen as a by-product .
