@@1256514 Impromptu preaching is a sermon technique where the preacher exhorts the congregation without any previous preparation . It can be aided with a reading of a Bible passage , aleatory opened or not , or even without any scriptural reference . Impromptu preaching was practiced by the Christian apostles . The Bible says that the Holy Spirit gives disciples the inspiration to speak : <BR> Matthew 10:16-20 <BR> ' ' : 16 : Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves . <BR> ' ' : 17 : But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ; <BR> ' ' : 18 : And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. <BR> ' ' : 19 : But when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 : For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you . ' ' According to some people , when Jesus says take no thought how or what ye shall speak he is saying that it is better not to script your speeches or sermons , but to let the Holy Spirit of your Father speak through you . Others see the expression as simply a comforting exhortation not to worry or be anxious , but to rest confident that God is in control ( cf. Phil . 2:12-13 ) . In other places the apostle Paul emphatically underscored the importance of diligent work in study and preparation ( I Tim . 4:13-16 ; II Tim . 2:15 ) . Today impromptu preaching is practiced by conservative Quakers , Mennonites and some Pentecostals.
