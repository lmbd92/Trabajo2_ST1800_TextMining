@@8380514 Thermometric titration is one of a number of instrumental titration techniques where endpoints can be located accurately and precisely without a subjective interpretation on the part of the analyst as to their location . Enthalpy change is arguably the most fundamental and universal property of chemical reactions , so the observation of temperature change is a natural choice in monitoring their progress . It is not a new technique , with possibly the first recognizable thermometric titration method reported early in the 20th century ( Bell and Cowell , 1913 ) . In spite of its attractive features , and in spite of the considerable research that has been conducted in the field and a large body of applications that have been developed ; it has been until now an under-utilized technique in the critical area of industrial process and quality control . Automated potentiometric titration systems have pre-dominated in this area since the 1970s . With the advent of cheap computers able to handle the powerful thermometric titration software , development has now reached the stage where easy to use automated thermometric titration systems can in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications of thermometric titrimetry discussed on this page are by no means exhaustive . The reader is referred to the bibliography for further reading on the subject . # Comparison between potentiometric and thermometric titrations. # Potentiometric titrimetry has been the predominant automated titrimetric technique since the 1970s , so it is worthwhile considering the basic differences between it and thermometric titrimetry . **25;578;TOOLONG titrations rely on a free energy change in the reaction system . Measurement of a free energy dependent term is necessary . : ' ' G ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = - ' ' RT ' ' ln ' ' K ' ' ( 1 ) Where : : G <sup> 0 </sup> = change on free energy : ' ' R ' ' = universal gas constant : ' ' T ' ' = temperature in kelvins ( K ) or degrees Rankine ( R ) : ' ' K ' ' = equilibrium constant at temperature ' ' T ' ' : ln is the natural logarithm function In order for a reaction to be amenable to potentiometric titrimetry , the free energy change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant inflection ( or kink ) in the titration curve where sensor response is plotted against the amount of titrant delivered . However , free energy is just one of three related parameters in describing any chemical reaction : : ' ' H ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = ' ' G ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> + ' ' T ' ' ' ' S ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> ( 2 ) where : : ' ' H ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = change in enthalpy : ' ' G ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = change in free energy : ' ' S ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = change in entropy : ' ' T ' ' = temperature in K For any reaction where the free energy is not opposed by the entropy change , the enthalpy change will be significantly greater than the free energy . Thus a titration based on a change in temperature ( which permits observation of the enthalpy change ) will show a greater inflection than will curves obtained from sensors reacting to free energy changes alone . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added at a known constant rate to a titrand until the completion of the reaction is indicated by a change in temperature . The endpoint is determined by an inflection in the curve generated by the output of a temperature measuring device . Consider the titration reaction : : ' ' a ' ' A + ' ' b ' ' B = ' ' p ' ' P ( 3 ) Where : : A = the titrant , and ' ' a ' ' = the corresponding number of moles reacting : B = the analyte , and ' ' b ' ' = the corresponding number of moles reacting : P = the product , and ' ' p ' ' = the corresponding number of moles produced At completion , the reaction produces a molar heat of reaction ' ' H ' ' <sub> r </sub> which is shown as a measurable temperature change ' ' T ' ' . In an ideal system , where no losses or gains of heat due to environmental influences are involved , the progress of the reaction is observed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether ' ' H ' ' <sub> r </sub> is negative ( indicating an exothermic reaction ) or positive ( indicating an endothermic reaction ) . In this context , environmental influences may include : *Heat losses or gains from outside the system via the vessel walls and cover ; *Differences in the temperature between the titrant and the titrand ; *Evaporative losses from the surface of the rapidly mixed fluid ; *Heats of solution when the titrant solvent is mixed with the analyte solvent ; *Heat introduced by the mechanical action of stirring ( minor influence ) ; and *Heat produced by the thermistor itself ( very minor influence ) . If the equilibrium for the reaction lies far to the right ( i.e. a stoichiometric equilibrium has been achieved ) , then when all analyte has been reacted by the titrant continuing addition of titrant will be revealed by a sharp break in the temperature/volume curve . Figures 1a and 1b illustrate idealized examples . The shape of experimentally obtained thermometric titration plots will vary from such idealized examples , and some of the environmental influences listed above may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can be due to insensitivity of the sensor or where thermal equilibrium at the endpoint is slow to occur . It can also occur where the reaction between titrant and titrand does not proceed to stoichiometric completion . The determinant of the degree to which a reaction will proceed to completion is the free energy change . If this is favourable , then the reaction will proceed to be completion and be essentially stoichiometric . In this case , the sharpness of the endpoint is dependent on the magnitude of the enthalpy change . If it is unfavourable , the endpoint will be rounded regardless of the magnitude of the enthalpy change . Reactions where non-stoichiometric equilibria are evident can be used to obtain satisfactory results using a thermometric titration approach . If the portions of the titration curve both prior to and after the endpoint are reasonably linear , then the intersection of tangents to these lines will accurately locate the endpoint . This is illustrated in Figure 2 . Consider the reaction for the equation ' ' a ' ' A + ' ' b ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-stoichiometric at equilibrium . Let A represent the titrant , and B the titrand . At the beginning of the titration , the titrand B is strongly in excess , and the reaction is pushed towards completion . Under these conditions , for a constant rate of titrant addition the temperature increase is constant and the curve is essentially linear until the endpoint is approached . In a similar manner , when the titrant is in excess past the endpoint , a linear temperature response can also be anticipated . Thus intersection of tangents will reveal the true endpoint . An actual thermometric titration plot for the determination of a strong base with a strong acid is illustrated in Figure 3 . The most practical sensor for measuring temperature change in titrating solutions has been found to be the thermistor . Thermistors are small solid state devices which exhibit relatively large changes in electrical resistance for small changes in temperature . They are manufactured from sintered mixed metal oxides , with lead wires enabling connection to electrical circuitry . The thermistor is encapsulated in a suitable electrically insulating medium with satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermistors used for chemical analysis the encapsulating medium is glass , although thermistors encapsulated in epoxy resin may be used in circumstances where either chemical attack ( e.g. , by acidic fluoride-containing solutions ) or severe mechanical stress is anticipated . The thermistor is supported by suitable electronic circuitry to maximize sensitivity to minute changes in solution temperature . The circuitry in the Metrohm 859 Titrotherm thermometric titration interface moldule is capable of resolving temperature changes as low as 10 <sup> 5 </sup> K. A critical element in modern automated thermometric titrimetry is the ability to locate the endpoint with a high degree of reproducibility . It is clearly impractical and insufficient for modern demands of accuracy and precision to estimate the inflection by intersection of tangents . This is done conveniently by derivatization of the temperature curve . The second derivative essentially locates the intersection of tangents to the temperature curve immediately pre- and post- the breakpoint . Thermistors respond quickly to small changes in temperature such as temperature gradients in the mixed titration solution , and thus the signal can exhibit a small amount of noise . Prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter ) the temperature curve in order to obtain sharp , symmetrical second derivative peaks which will accurately locate the correct inflection point . This is illustrated in Figure 5 . The degree of digital smoothing is optimized for each determination , and is stored as a method parameter for application every time a titration for that particular analysis is run . Because enthalpy change is a universal characteristic of chemical reactions , thermometric endpoint sensing can be applied to a wide range of titration types , e.g. * Acid/base * Redox * Complexometric ( EDTA ) and * Precipitation Further , since the sensor is not required to interact with the titration solution electrochemically , titrations in non-conducting media can be performed , as can titrations using reactions for which no convenient or cost-effective potentiometric sensor is available . Thermometric titrations generally demand rapid reaction kinetics in order to obtain sharp reproducible endpoints . Where reaction kinetics are slow , and direct titrations between titrant and titrand are not possible , indirect or back-titrations often can be devised to solve the problem . Catalytically enhanced endpoints can be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small and endpoints would not be detected satisfactorily by the titration software . The suitability of a particular chemical reaction as a candidate for a thermometric titration procedure can generally be predicted on the basis of the estimated amount of analyte present in the sample and the enthalpy of the reaction . However , other parameters such as the kinetics of the reaction , the sample matrix itself , heats of dilution and losses of heat to the environment can affect the outcome . A properly designed experimental program is the most reliable way of determining the viability of a thermometric titration approach . Successful applications for thermometric titrations are generally where titrant-titrand reaction kinetics are fast , and chemical equilibria are stoichiometric or nearly so . # Thermometric titration determinations may be recommended where # * The analyst wishes to simplify the conduct of a variety of titrations by using one sensor for all . For example , a laboratory might conduct routinely acid/base , redox , complexometric , sulfate and chloride titrations . A single thermometric sensor in conjunction with an autosampler will enable all titrations to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titration sensors . After preparation of the samples and placing in the carousel , the analyst assigns the appropriate thermometric method to the beaker position in the carousel . * The titration environment is considered unsuitable for conventional titration sensors . For example , glass membrane pH electrodes must be kept adequately hydrated for proper operation . The use of such electrodes in substantially non-aqueous media as in the determination of trace acids in lipids and lubricating oils can lead to loss of performance as the membrane fouls and dehydrates , and/or if the reference junction is partly or completely blocked . It is often necessary to keep a number of electrodes cycling through a rejuvenation program in order to keep up with an analytical workload . Thermometric sensors have no electrochemical interaction with the titrating solution , and therefore can be used on a continuous basis with essentially no maintenance . Similarly , the potentiometric titration of sulfate with barium chloride in various industrial samples can lead to rapid degradation of the indicating barium ion selective electrode. * A thermometric titration methodology which can not be emulated using other types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other techniques . Examples are the determination of fluoride by titration with boric acid , the analysis of orthophosphate by titration with magnesium ions , and the direct titration of aluminium with fluoride ions # Apparatus and setup for automated thermometric titrimetry # A suitable setup for automated thermometric titrimetry comprises the following : * Precision fluid dispensing devices burettes for adding titrants and dosing of other reagents * Thermistor-based thermometric sensor * Titration vessel * Stirring device , capable of highly efficient stirring of vessel contents without splashing * Computer with thermometric titration operating system * Thermometric titration interface module this regulates the data flow between the burettes , sensors and the computer Figure 6 illustrates a modern automated thermometric titration system based on the Metrohm 859 Titrotherm interface module with Thermoprobe sensor , Metrohm 800 Dosino dispensing devices and a computer running the operational software . Figure 7 is a schematic of the relationship between components in automated thermometric titration system . A = dosing device B = thermometric sensor C = stirring device D = thermometric titration interface module E = computer # Types of thermometric titration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groupings , namely : * Acid-base tritration * Redox titration * Precipitation titration * Complexometric titration Because the sensor does not interact electrically or electrochemically with the solution , electrical conductance of the titrating medium is not a pre-requisite for a determination . Titrations may be carried out in completely non-conducting , non-polar media if required . Further , titrations may be carried out in turbid solutions or even suspensions of solids , and titrations where precipitates are reaction products can be contemplated . The range of possible thermometric titration applications far exceeds the actual experience of this writer , and the reader will be referred to the appropriate literature in some instances . # Acid-base titrations # # # Determination of fully dissociated acids and bases . # # The heat of neutralization of a fully dissociated acid with a fully dissociated base is approximately 56kJ/mol . The reaction is thus strongly exothermic , and is an excellent basis for a wide range of analysis in industry . An advantage for the industrial analyst is that the use of stronger titrants ( 1 to 2 mol/L ) permits a reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often be directly and accurately dispensed into the titration vessel prior to titration. # # Titration of weak acids # # Weakly dissociated acids yield sharp thermometric endpoints when titrated with a strong base . For instance , bicarbonate can be unequivocally determined in the company of carbonate by titrating with hydroxyl ( <sup> 0 </sup> H <sub> r </sub> =-40.9 kJ/mol ) . # Titration of acid mixtures # Mixtures of complex acids can be resolved by thermometric titration with standard NaOH in aqueous solution . In a mixture of nitric , acetic and phosphoric acids used in the fabrication of semi-conductors , three endpoints could be predicted on the basis of the dissociation constants of the acids : The key to determine the amount of each acid present in the mixture is the ability to obtain an accurate value for the amount of phosphoric acid present , as revealed by titration of the third proton of H <sub> 3 </sub> PO <sub> 4 </sub> . Figure 10 illustrates a titration plot of this mixture , showing 3 sharp endpoints . # Titration of complex alkaline solutions # The thermometric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the production of alumina from bauxite is accomplished in an automated two titration sequence . This is an adaptation of a classic thermometric titration application ( VanDalen and Ward , 1973 ) . In the first titration , tartrate solution is added to an aliquot of liquor to complex aluminate , releasing one mole of hydroxyl for each mole of aluminate present . This is titrated acidimetrically along with free hydroxyl present and the carbonate content ( as a second endpoint ) . The second titration is preceded by the automatic addition of fluoride solution . The alumina-tartrate complex is broken in favour of the formation of an aluminium fluoride complex and the concomitant release of three moles of hydroxyl for each mole of aluminium present , which are then titrated acidimetrically . The whole determination can be completed in less than 5 minutes . # Non-aqueous acid-base titrations # Non-aqueous acid-base titrations can be carried out advantageously by thermometric means . Acid leach solutions from some copper mines can contain large quantities of Fe(III) as well as Cu(II) . The free acid ( sulfuric acid ) content of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titrimetry can determine the free acid content with modest amounts of Fe(III) , in some solutions the Fe(III) content is so high as to cause serious interference . Complexation with necessarily large amounts of oxalate is undesirable due to the toxicity of the reagent . A thermometric titration was devised by diluting the aliquot with propan-2-ol and titration with standard KOH in propan-2-ol . Most of the metal content precipitated prior to the commencement of the titration , and a clear , sharp endpoint for the sulfuric acid content was obtained . # Catalyzed endpoint thermometric acid-base titrations # The determination of trace acids in organic matrices is a common analytical task assigned to titrimetry . Examples are Total Acid Number ( TAN ) in mineral and lubricating oils and Free Fatty Acids ( FFA ) in edible fats and oils . Automated potentiometric titration procedures have been granted standard method status , for example by ASTM for TAN and AOAC for FFA . The methodology is similar in both instances . The sample is dissolved in a suitable solvent mixture ; say a hydrocarbon and an alcohol which also must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to enhance the electrical conductivity of the solution . The trace acids are titrated with standard base in an alcohol . The sample environment is essentially hostile to the pH electrode used to sense the titration . The electrode must be taken out of service on a regular basis to rehydrate the glass sensing membrane , which is also in danger of fouling by the oily sample solution . A recent thermometric titrimetric procedure for the determination of FFA developed by Cameiro ' ' et al . ' ' ( 2002 ) has been shown to be particularly amenable to automation . It is fast , highly precise , and results agree very well with those obtained by the official AOAC method . The temperature change for the titration of very weak acids such as oleic acid by 0.1 mol/L KOH in propan-2-ol is too small to yield an accurate endpoint . In this procedure , a small amount of paraformaldehyde as a fine powder is added to the titrand before the titration . At the endpoint , the first excess of hydroxyl ions catalyzes the depolymerization of paraformaldehyde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The titration plot is illustrated in Figure 13 . The speed of this titration coupled with its precision and accuracy makes it ideal for the analysis of FFA in biodiesel feedstocks and product . # Redox titrations # # Titrations with permanganate and dichromate # Redox reactions are normally strongly exothermic , and can make excellent candidates for thermometric titrations . In the classical determination of ferrous ion with permanganate , the reaction enthalpy is more than double that of a strong acid/strong base titration : <sup> 0 </sup> ' ' H ' ' <sub> r </sub> = 123.9 kJ/mol of Fe . The determination of hydrogen peroxide by permanganate titration is even more strongly exothermic at <sup> 0 </sup> ' ' H ' ' <sub> r </sub> = 149.6 kJ/mol H <sub> 2 </sub> O <sub> 2 </sub> # Titrations with thiosulfate # In the determination of hypochlorite ( for example in commercial bleach formulations ) , a direct titration with thiosulfate can be employed without recourse to an iodometric finish . : ClO <sup> </sup> + H <sub> 2 </sub> O + 2e <sup> </sup> &amp;harr ; Cl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 </sub> O <sub> 3 </sub> <sup> 2 </sup> &amp;harr ; S <sub> 4 </sub> O <sub> 6 </sub> <sup> 2 </sup> + 2e <sup> </sup> </u> : 2S <sub> 2 </sub> O <sub> 3 </sub> <sup> 2 </sup> +ClO <sup> </sup> +H <sub> 2 </sub> O &amp;harr ; S <sub> 4 </sub> O <sub> 6 </sub> <sup> 2 </sup> +Cl <sup> </sup> +2OH <sup> </sup> Thermometric iodometric titrations employing thiosulfate as a titrant are also practical , for example in the determination of Cu(II) . In this instance , it has been found advantageous to incorporate the potassium iodide reagent with the thiosulfate titrant in such proportions that iodine is released into solution just prior to its reduction by thiosulfate . This minimizes iodine losses during the course of the titration. # Titrations with hypochlorite # While relatively unstable and requiring frequent standardization , sodium hypochlorite has been used in a very rapid thermometric titration method for the determination of ammonium ion . This is an alternative to the classical approach of ammonia distillation from basic solution and consequent acid-base titration . The thermometric titration is carried out in bicarbonate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . # Complexometric ( EDTA ) titrations # Thermometric titrations employing sodium salts of **27;605;TOOLONG acid ( EDTA ) have been demonstrated for the determination of a range of metal ions . Reaction enthalpies are modest , so titrations are normally carried out with titrant concentrations of 1 mol/L . This necessitates the use of the tetra-sodium salt of EDTA rather than the more common di-sodium salt which is saturated at a concentration of only approximately 0.25 mol/L . An excellent application is the sequential determination of calcium and magnesium . Although calcium reacts exothermically with EDTA ( heat of chelation -23.4 kJ/mol ) , magnesium reacts endothermically with a heat of chelation of +20.1 kJ/mol . This is illustrated in the titration plot of EDTA with calcium and magnesium in sea water ( Figure 18 ) . Following the solution temperature curve , the breakpoint for the calcium content ( red-tagged endpoint ) is followed by a region of modest temperature rise due to competition between the heats of dilution of the titrant with the solution , and the endothermic reaction of Mg <sup> 2+ </sup> and EDTA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( blue-tagged endpoint ) by EDTA is revealed by upswing in temperature caused purely by the heat of dilution . Direct EDTA titrations with metal ions are possible when reaction kinetics are fast , for example zinc , copper , calcium and magnesium . However , with slower reaction kinetics such as those exhibited by cobalt and nickel , back-titrations are used . Titrations for cobalt and nickel are carried out in an ammoniacal environment ; buffered with ammonia:ammonium chloride solution . An excess of EDTA is added , and is back-titrated with Cu(II) solution . It is postulated that the breakpoint is revealed by the difference in reaction enthalpies between the formation of the Cu-EDTA complex , and that for the formation of the Cu-amine complex . A catalyzed endpoint procedure to determine trace amounts of metal ions in solution ( down to approximately 10 mg/L ) employs 0.01 mol/L EDTA . This has been applied to the determination of low level Cu(II) in specialized plating baths , and to the determination of total hardness in water . The reaction enthalpies of EDTA with most metal ions are often quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed with commensurately high amounts of titrand in order to obtain sharp , reproducible endpoints . Using a catalytically indicated endpoint , very low EDTA titrant concentrations can be used . A back-titration is used . An excess of EDTA solution is added . The excess of EDTA is back-titrated with a suitable metal ion such as Mn <sup> 2+ </sup> or Cu <sup> 2+ </sup> . At the endpoint , the first excess of metal ion catalyzes a strongly exothermic reaction between a polyhdric phenol ( such as resorcinol ) and hydrogen peroxide. # Precipitation titrations # Thermometric titrimetry is particularly suited to the determination of a range of analytes where a precipitate is formed by reaction with the titrant . In some cases , an alternative to traditional potentiometric titration practice can be offered . In other cases , reaction chemistries may be employed for which there is no satisfactory equivalent in potentiometric titrimetry. # Titrations with silver nitrate # Thermometric titrations of silver nitrate with halides and cyanide are all possible . The reaction of silver nitrate with chloride is strongly exothermic . For instance , the reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a high 61.2 kJ/mol . This permits convenient determination of chloride with commonly available standard 0.1 mol/L AgNO <sub> 3 </sub> . Endpoints are very sharp , and with care , chloride concentrations down to 15 mg/L can be analyzed . Bromide and chloride may be determined in admixture. # Titration of sulfate # Sulfate may be rapidly and easily titrated thermometrically using standard solutions of Ba <sup> 2+ </sup> as titrant . Industrially , the procedure has been applied to the determination of sulfate in brine ( including electrolysis brines ) , in nickel refining solutions and particularly for sulfate in wet process phosphoric acid , where it has proven to be quite popular . The procedure can also be used to assist in the analysis of complex acid mixtures containing sulfuric acid where resorting to titration in non-aqueous media is not feasible . The reaction enthalpy for the formation of barium sulfate is a modest 18.8 kJ/mol . This can place a restriction on the lower limit of sulfate in a sample which can be analyzed. # Titration of aluminium with fluoride # Thermometric titrimetry offers a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution . A solution of aluminium is conditioned with acetate buffer and an excess of sodium and potassium ions . Titration with sodium or potassium fluoride yields the exothermic precipitation of an insoluble alumino-fluoride salt . : Al <sup> 3+ </sup> + Na <sup> + </sup> + 2K <sup> + </sup> + 6F <sup> </sup> K <sub> 2 </sub> NaAlF <sub> 6 </sub> Because 6 mole of fluoride react with one mole of aluminium , the titration is particularly precise , and a coefficient of variance ( CV ) of 0.03 has been achieved in the analysis of alum . When aluminium ion ( say as aluminium nitrate ) is employed as the titrant , fluoride can be determined using the same chemistry . This titration is useful in the determination of fluoride in complex acid mixtures used as etchants in the semi-conductor industry . # Titration of total orthophosphate # Orthophosphate ion can be conveniently thermometrically titrated with magnesium ions in the presence of ammonium ion . An aliquot of sample is buffered to approximately pH10 with an NH <sub> 3 </sub> /NH <sub> 4 </sub> Cl solution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 </sub> <sup> + </sup> + PO <sub> 4 </sub> <sup> 3- </sup> MgNH <sub> 4 </sub> PO <sub> 4 </sub> Is exothermic . CVs of under 0.1 have been achieved in test applications . The procedure is suitable for the determination of orthophosphate in fertilizers and other products . # Titration of nickel # Nickel can be titrated thermometrically using di-sodium dimethylglyoximate as titrant . The chemistry is analogous to the classic gravimetric procedure , but the time taken for a determination can be reduced from many hours to a few minutes . Potential interferences need to be considered . # Titration of anionic and cationic surfactants # Anionic and cationic surfactants can be determined thermometrically by titrating one type against the other . For instance , benzalkonium chloride ( a quaternary type cationic surfactant ) may be determined in cleaners and algaecides for swimming pools and spas by titrating with a standard solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate . Alternatively , anionic surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate can be titrated with cetyl pyridinium chloride . # Titration of non-ionic surfactants # When an excess of Ba <sup> 2+ </sup> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxide derivative type , a pseudo-cationic complex is formed . This may be titrated with standard sodium tetraphenylborate . Two moles tetraphenylborate react with one mole of the Ba <sup> 2+ </sup> / non-ionic surfactant complex . # Miscellaneous aqueous titrations # # Titration of fluoride with boric acid # Acidic solutions of fluoride ( including hydrofluoric acid ) can be determined by a simple thermometric titration with boric acid . : B(OH) <sub> 3 </sub> + 3F <sup> </sup> + 3H <sup> + </sup> BF <sub> 3 </sub> + 3H <sub> 2 </sub> O The titration plot illustrated in Figure 19 shows that the endpoint is quite rounded , suggesting that the reaction might not proceed to stoichiometric equilibrium . However , since the regions of the temperature curve immediately before and after the endpoint are quite linear , the second derivative of this curve ( representing the intersection of tangents ) will accurately locate the endpoint . Indeed , excellent precision can be obtained with this titration , with a CV of less than 0.1. # Determination of formaldehyde # Formaldehyde can be determined in electroless copper plating solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and titrating the liberated hydroxyl ion with standard acid . : H <sub> 2 </sub> C=O + HSO <sub> 3 </sub> <sup> </sup> + H <sub> 2 </sub> O HO-CH <sub> 2 </sub> -SO <sub> 3 </sub> <sup> </sup> + OH <sup> </sup> # References # #J .
