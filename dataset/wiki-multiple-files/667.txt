@@2806514 Henry Winstanley ( 31 March 1644 27 November 1703 ) was an English painter and engineer who constructed the first Eddystone lighthouse . # Early life and career # He was born in Saffron Walden , Essex , and baptised there on 31 March 1644 . His father Henry became land steward to the Earl of Suffolk , owner of Audley End House , in 1652 , and young Henry also worked at Audley End , first as a porter and then as a secretary . In 1666 Audley End House was bought by Charles II for use as a base when attending Newmarket races , and it became effectively a royal palace . Winstanley developed an interest in engraving after a grand tour of Europe between 1669 and 1674 , where he was impressed by Continental architecture and the engravings in which it was portrayed . On his return he is believed to have studied engraving with Wenceslas Hollar , and was employed at Audley End House as assistant to the Clerk of Works . In 1676 he embarked on a detailed set of architectural engravings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which survive as an important early record of English manor house architecture . He also designed a set of playing cards which became very popular and sold well . He was appointed Clerk of Works at Audley End in 1679 on the death of his predecessor , and held the post until 1701 . Winstanley was well known in Essex for his fascination with gadgets both mechanical and hydraulic . He had a house built for him at Littlebury which he filled with whimsical mechanisms of his own design and construction , and the Essex House of Wonders became a local landmark popular with visitors . In the 1690s he opened a Mathematical Water Theatre known as Winstanley 's Water-works in London 's Piccadilly . This was a commercial visitor attraction which combined fireworks , perpetual fountains , automata and ingenious mechanisms of all kinds , including The Wonderful Barrel of 1696 which served visitors with hot and cold drinks from the same piece of equipment . It was a successful and profitable venture and continued to operate for some years after its creators death . # Construction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the money he had made from his work and commercial enterprises in five ships . Two of them were wrecked on the Eddystone Rocks near Plymouth , and he demanded to know why nothing was done to protect vessels from this hazard . Told that the reef was too treacherous to mark , he declared that he would build a lighthouse there himself , and the Admiralty agreed to support him with ships and men . Construction started on 14 July 1696 . The octagonal tower was to be built from Cornish granite and wood , with ornamental features and a glass lantern-room in which candles would burn to provide the light , and was to be anchored to the rock by 12 huge iron stanchions . One notable incident during its construction occurred in June 1697 . At this time Britain and France were at war , and a naval vessel had been assigned to protect the workers whenever they were on the reef . On this particular day , the commissioner at Plymouth , George St Lo , ordered the ship to join the fleet and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work done so far on the foundations and carried Winstanley off to France . Louis XIV , however , ordered his immediate release , with the words : France is at war with England , not with humanity . Winstanley returned to the Eddystone reef , construction resumed , and the first Eddystone Lighthouse was completed in November 1698 . The lighthouse suffered some weather damage during the winter of 1698 - 1699 , and the light was often obscured by spray breaking over the top of the tower . Winstanley therefore had it rebuilt the following spring on a larger scale , with extra stonework and even more elaborate decoration . Once finished , however , it fulfilled its function . During the five years Winstanley 's lighthouses operated , no ships were wrecked on the Eddystone. # Death # Winstanley was recorded as having expressed great faith in his construction , going so far as to wish that he might be inside it during the greatest storm there ever was .
