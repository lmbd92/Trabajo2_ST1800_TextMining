@@27383514 This is a list of Indian princely states , as they existed prior to 1947 . Before the Partition of India in 1947 , hundreds of Princely States , also called Native States , existed in India which were not part of British India . These were the parts of the Indian subcontinent which had not been conquered or annexed by the British . The states are listed alphabetically ; this list complements the List of princely states of India which is arranged by region . Geographical and administrative assigning is indicative , as various names and borders have changed significantly , even entities ( provinces , principalities ) split , merged , renamed ' ' et cetera ' ' . Furthermore , criteria of statehood ( used for inclusion ) differ between sources . In some cases , several name variations or completely different names are included . # Alphabetical list of former British India 's princely states # # A # *Achrol in Rajasthan - Thikana of the Princely State of Jaipur *Agar *Agra Barkhera *Ahmadnagar -
