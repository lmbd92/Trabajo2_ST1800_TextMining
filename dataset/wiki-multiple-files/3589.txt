@@33251514 Italian Libya Railways was a group of small railways built in the Italian colony of Libya between the two World Wars . # History # The Kingdom of Italy built in Italian Libya nearly 400 km of railways with gauge . # Projects # The Italian authorities decided to give priority to the construction of roads in Libya when Benito Mussolini took control of the Italian colonies . After 1926 no more railways were made in Libya , but during World War II the need of railways transport to the front during the war in the frontier with British Egypt changed this approach . In spring 1941 the Italian government started the construction of a new railway between Tripoli and Benghazi , but by the end of 1942 all was stopped because of the Italian defeat in north Africa : only 18 km were done in Cirenaica. # Equipment # In Libya the first locomotives were the steam locomotives R.401 and R.301 , but the most successful were the R.302 produced in northern Italy . # Railways # There were only five small railways : 1 ) Tripoli-Zuara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km ) : 3 ) Tripoli-Garian ( 90 km ) : 4 ) Bengasi-Soluch ( 56 km ) : 5 ) Tripoli-Tagiura ( 21 km ) : <gallery> File:Tripoli Stazione Centrale.jpgTripoli Railway Station in 1940 File:Benghazi Central Station.jpgBenghazi Railway Station in 1930 File:Barce Stazione Centrale.jpgBarce Railway station in 1930 File:Benghazi Italiana.JPGItalian Benghazi with port railways File:Fiat Train Passing in to Cyrenaica.jpgFiat Littorina passing in Cirenaica File:Fiat train at Tripoli 's railway central station.jpgFiat train at Tripoli Station File:Central railway station of Tripoli.jpgOld steam train at Tripoli Station in 1920 File:Benghazi Railway System after World War II.jpgDestruction of Benghazi station in 1943 </gallery>
