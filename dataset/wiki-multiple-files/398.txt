@@1290514 The Salvadori 's teal or Salvadori 's duck ( ' ' Salvadorina waigiuensis ' ' ) is a species of bird native to New Guinea . It is placed in the monotypic genus ' ' Salvadorina ' ' . Initially , it was believed to belong to the perching ducks , a paraphyletic assemblage of species which generally fell between dabbling ducks and shelducks . With the breaking-up of the perching ducks , it was rather provisionally placed in the dabbling duck genus ' ' Anas ' ' . It was then reinstated in its own genus and moved to the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae , which also contains the torrent duck and blue duck which convergently have evolved adaptations to mountain stream habitat . All or some of these species may actually be surviving lineages of an ancient Gondwanan radiation of waterfowl ( Sraml ' ' et al . ' ' 1996 ) . It has a dark brown head and neck , and its body is barred and spotted dark brown and off white , with orange legs and a yellow bill . It is a secretive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.700m in the mountains . It is one of only four waterfowl species that are adapted to life on fast-flowing rivers , the other being the torrent , the blue and harlequin duck . It is an omnivore . It locates its nest near water , and lays 2 to 4 eggs in the dry season . The Salvadori 's teal is the sole endemic duck species of the island of New Guinea . The IUCN has listed the bird as vulnerable , and the total population may be slowly declining . The name commemorates the Italian naturalist Tommaso Salvadori. # References # *Beehler , Bruce M. , Pratt , Thane K. &amp; Zimmerman , Dale A. ( 1986 ) : ' ' Birds of New Guinea ' ' .
