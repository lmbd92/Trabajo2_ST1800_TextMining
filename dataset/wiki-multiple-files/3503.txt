@@32273514 The Minisci reaction is a named reaction in organic chemistry . It is a radical substitution to an aromatic compound , in particular to a heteroaromatic base , that introduces an alkyl group . The reaction was published about in 1971 by F. Minisci . The aromatic compound is generally electron-deficient and with N-aromatic compounds the nitrogen atom is protonated . A typical reaction is that between pyridine and pivalic acid to 2-tert-butylpyridine with silver nitrate , sulfuric acid and ammonium persulfate . The reaction resembles Friedel-Crafts alkylation but with opposite reactivity and selectivity . The Minisci reaction proceeds regioselectively and enables the introduction of a wide range of alkyl groups . A side-reaction is acylation . The ratio between alkylation and acylation depends on the substrate and the reaction conditions . Due to the simple raw materials and the simple reaction conditions the reaction has many applications in heterocyclic chemistry . # Mechanism # A free radical is formed from the carboxylic acid in an oxidative decarboxylation with silver salts and an oxidizing agent . The oxidizing agent reoxidizes the silver salt . The radical then reacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rearomatisation . The acylated product is formed from the acyl radical . # References #
