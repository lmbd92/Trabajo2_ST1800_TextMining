@@17806514 Levi Richardson ( 1851 - April 5 , 1879 ) was an Old West gunman , gambler and buffalo hunter . During his lifetime , Richardson was quite well known . Richardson was born in Wisconsin , migrating to Dodge City , Kansas after first working for a lengthy period as a buffalo hunter . When he first arrived in Dodge City , his reputation as being a gunman came with him , although it was mostly , if not all , hearsay . Richardson no doubt had been involved in several shootouts with Native Americans while on the plains , but as to actual Old West gunfights , no records are known to exist , his only confirmed gunfight being the one in which he was killed . It is believed that Richardson first arrived in Dodge City around 1874 , drifting in and out over time , spending much of his time gambling , and in doing so making that his primary employment . He quickly became well known around the cattle town , and was not particularly well liked , although some sources say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known him during his buffalo hunting days , to include Eugene LeCompt and H.H. Henry Raymond , who said at best he was an unpleasant man . During this time he met in passing Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday . He also met and became friends with Frank Loving , a young gambler . By all accounts , Loving and Richardson got along well until early 1879 , at which time evidently Loving , who had married , believed Richardson was acting inappropriately and disrespectfully toward the latters wife , Mattie . This led to problems between the two men , resulting in numerous verbal clashes , and in March , 1879 , the two became involved in a fist fight on Front Street . After that fight , Richardson told Loving I 'll blow the guts out of you , you cockeyed son of a bitch , to which Loving , who was not armed at the time , simply turned and walked away . The arguments between the two men culminated in Richardson walking into the ' ' Long Branch Saloon ' ' on April 5 , 1879 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Loving was not in the saloon at the time , so Richardson waited for him , with Loving appearing some time after 9:00pm . Loving seated himself near a potbellied stove at a long table , at which time Richardson went and joined him . The two , by witness accounts , had a low conversation which no one could hear , then suddenly Richardson stood and said You would n't fight anything , you damn son of a bitch , to which Loving calmly and simply replied Try me and see . Richardson drew his gun first , prompting Loving to do the same , with the two men less than an arms length apart . Richardson fired five rounds to Loving 's six , with Richardson grazing Loving 's hand , but himself receiving bullet wounds to his chest , side and arm . Deputy Town Marshal Duffy entered the saloon first , disarming Richardson as the latter fell to the floor . Town Marshal Charlie Bassett arrived also , and Loving was arrested , standard procedure in such a case . Richardson died on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence in a coroners inquest , with no trial . The gunfight , which later became known as the ' ' Long Branch Saloon Gunfight ' ' , gave notoriety to Loving .
