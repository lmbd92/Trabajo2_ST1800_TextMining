@@7911514 ' ' Cross That Line ' ' is the fourth album by British pop musician Howard Jones , released in April 1989 . It featured two hit singles The Prisoner ( #30 US ) and Everlasting Love ( #12 US ) , though neither of these singles or the album itself were successful in Jones 's native UK . The album was produced by Jones with Ian Stanley , Chris Hughes , and Ross Cullum - all of whom had worked with Tears For Fears earlier in the 1980s . The music video for The Prisoner was notably innovative at the time , mixing multiple photo and video editing tricks at a time when computer-based graphics effects were not widely in use . # Track listing # All songs written by Howard Jones . # The Prisoner - 4:38 # Everlasting Love - 4:16 # Powerhouse - 3:26 # Last Supper - 5:18 # Cross That Line - 4:42 # Out of Thin Air - 3:07 # Guardians of the Breath - 7:34 # Fresh Air Waltz - 3:59 # Wanders to You - 5:08 # Those Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocals , keyboards , piano , Fairlight guitar ; Hammond organ ( on Powerhouse ) ; drums ( on Last Supper ) ; flute solo on Cross That Line *Ian Stanley - keyboards on The Prisoner , Everlasting Love *Chris Hughes - drums on The Prisoner , Everlasting Love *Andy Ross - guitar on The Prisoner , Everlasting Love *Martin Jones ( Howard 's brother ) - guitar on Everlasting Love ; Wal bass on Cross That Line , Out of Thin Air , Fresh Air Waltz , Wanders to You *Phil Palmer - guitar on Powerhouse , Cross That Line , Wanders to You ; acoustic guitar on Last Supper *Trevor Morais - drum kit on Powerhouse , Cross That Line , Wanders to You *Simon Clarke - alto sax on Powerhouse , Cross That Line , Wanders to You ; flute on Cross That Line , Wanders to You *Roddy Lorimer - trumpet on Powerhouse ; flugelhorn solo on Cross That Line , Wanders to You *Steve Sidwell - trumpet on Powerhouse *Tim Sanders - tenor sax on Powerhouse , Cross That Line , Wanders to You *Peter Thoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocals on Everlasting Love *Inga Humpe - vocals on Powerhouse *Claudia Fontaine - backing vocals on Cross That Line
