@@35080514 In vibrational spectroscopy , an overtone band is the spectral band that occurs in a vibrational spectrum of a molecule when the molecule makes a transition from the ground state ( v=0 ) to the second excited state ( v=2 ) , where v is the vibrational quantum number that one gets after solving the Schrdinger equation for the molecule under consideration . It takes only non-negative integer values . Generally , in order to study the vibrational spectra of molecules , the vibration of the chemical bonds is assumed to be simple harmonic.Thus the parabolic simple harmonic potential is used in the Schrdinger equation to solve for the vibrational energy eigenstates . When the Schrdinger equation is solved one gets the functional forms of the vibrational energy eigenstates . These energy states are found to be quantised , meaning they can assume only some discrete values of energy . When electromagnetic radiation is shined on a sample of a molecule , the molecules can absorb energy from the electromagnetic radiation and change their vibrational energy state . However , the molecules can absorb energy from radiation only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the electric dipole moment of the molecule when it is vibrating . This change in the electric dipole moment of the molecule leads to the transition dipole moment of the molecule , for transition from the lower to higher energy state , being non-zero which is an essential condition for any transition ( process , change ) to take place in the vibrational state of the molecule , as is the law of nature , explained thoroughly in Quantum mechanics . It has been found that , when the bonds are considered vibrating simple-harmonically , the transition dipole moment is non-zero only for the transition where v=1 . Hence ; for the ideal , non-existent , simple-harmonically vibrating bond ; there can never be any overtone observed in the vibrational spectrum . But , real molecules do not vibrate simple-harmonically . The potential function vibration is not parabolic , simple-harmonic potential , but is better approximated by the Morse potential . When Schrdinger equation is solved for the molecule under consideration with Morse potential as the potential function , one gets the functional forms of the vibrational energy eigenstates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding to transitions from various energy levels to various other energy levels , the transition dipole moment does not become zero for the transitions where v=2 , 3 , 4 , etc . Thus , for real molecules , the allowed transitions are those for which v=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc . The overtone band observed in the IR spectrum is one such transition with v=2 , from v=0 to v=2 energy state . However it has been experimentally found that the intensity of the overtone band is very low compared to the fundamental band .
