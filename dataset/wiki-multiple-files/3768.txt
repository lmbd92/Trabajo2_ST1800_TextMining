@@35739514 ' ' Green v Lord Somerleyton ' ' 2003 EWCA Civ 198 is an English land law case , concerning easements. # Facts # Green had dykes . Water from Lord Someleytons land drained into the dykes , and Green brought an action in nuisance to stop it happening after a serious flood that came from a lake on Somerleytons property . Water had flowed from it through marshland . The trustees of Lord Somerleytons land counterclaimed that they had an easement for the water drainage , from a 1921 conveyance by implied reservation . Judge held there was no remedy in nuisance for naturally flowing water under ' ' Leakey v National Trust ' ' 1980 QB 485. # Judgment # Jonathan Parker LJ held that nuisance could cover floodwater . But Green had not made clear what action they ought to take , nor had he taken action to reduce risk himself . Furthermore , the provisions in the drainage deed were incorporated by reference into the conveyance to Green , and by implication those drainage rights were intended to be proprietary . So Somerleyton did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of draining the said lands i.e. Scale Marshes and Priory Marshes and effectually drain the same . # 116 . It also imposed obligations on the purchaser , Mr Mallett , to keep the dykes on Priory Marshes cleansed and open and in proper order . 117 . Given the terms of the 1921 Drainage Deed , and their express incorporation by reference into the 1921 Conveyance , the conclusion seems to me to be inescapable that the 1921 Conveyance impliedly reserved to Lord Somerleyton and his successors in title to Scale Marshes an easement of drainage through the existing dykes in the terms claimed by the Trustees .
