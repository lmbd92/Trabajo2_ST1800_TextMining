@@30695514 Marguerite of Burgundy ( referred to as Anne by some sources ; 11921243 ) , was , by marriage , Countess of Savoy from 1233 until her death . She was the youngest daughter of Hugh III , Duke of Burgundy , and his second wife , Batrice of Albon . In c. 1217 , she married Amadeus IV , Count of Savoy . As dowry , she brought Miribel castle , Ornacieux castle , and other properties in Viennois territory . The marriage was agreed to as part of a treaty between the families , including terms not to acquire further territories within each other 's dominions . She and her new husband were also designated as heirs for her brother Guigues VI of Viennois after any children of his . She also personally inherited some money upon the death of her mother . The 1267 will of her nephew Guigues VII of Viennois confirmed donations of property which she had made . Marguerite and Amadeus had two daughters : * Beatrice of Savoy ( d. 1258 ) , married firstly in 1233 to Manfred III of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , 1247 to Manfred of Sicily * Margaret of Savoy ( d. 1254 ) , married firstly on December 9 , 1235 to Boniface II of Montferrat , married secondly to Aymar III , Count of Valentinois Note that some scholars are unclear on Marguerite 's given name . One source calls her Anne , but that same source in another location indicates that the name could equally be Marguerite . Another source is clear that it is Marguerite , with sourcing of its own . A book about the house of Savoy at this time mentions the debate regarding her name , but finds a source which Cox finds settles the debate .
