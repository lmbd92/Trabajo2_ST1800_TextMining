The state was established in the aftermath of the Hungarian Revolutions of 19181919 by counter-revolutionary forces who sought to return to the status quo prior to 31 October 1918. # History # On 6 August 1919 Istvn Friedrich , leader of the White House Comrades Association ( a right-wing , counter-revolutionary group ) , ousted the government of Gyula Peidl and seized power in a bloodless coup with the backing of the Royal Romanian Army .

A white terror ensued that led to the imprisonment , torture , and execution without trial of communists , socialists , Jews , leftist intellectuals , sympathizers with the Krolyi and Kun regimes , and others who threatened the traditional Hungarian political order that the officers sought to re-establish . Estimates placed the number of executions at approximately 5,000 . In addition , about 75,000 people were jailed .
