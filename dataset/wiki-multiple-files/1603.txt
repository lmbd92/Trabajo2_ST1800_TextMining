@@11395514 MEROPS is an on-line database for peptidases ( also known as proteases ) and their inhibitors . The classification scheme for peptidases was published by Rawlings &amp; Barrett in 1993 , and that for protein inhibitors by Rawlings ' ' et al . ' ' in 2004. # Overview # The classification is based on similarities at the tertiary and primary structural levels . Comparisons are restricted to that part of the sequence directly involved in the reaction , which in the case of a peptidase must include the active site , and for a protein inhibitor the reactive site . The classification is hierarchical : sequences are assembled into families , and families are assembled into clans . A family is assembled around a ' ' type example ' ' , the sequence of a well-characterized peptidase or inhibitor . All other sequences in the family must be related to the family type example , either directly or through a transitive relationship involving one or more sequences already shown to be family members . Typically , FastA or BlastP are used to establish sequence relationships , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistically significant . A clan is also assembled around a type example , this being the structure of a well-characterized peptidase or inhibitor . A family is included in a clan if the tertiary structure of a family member can be shown to be related to that of the clan type example . Typically , DALI is used to establish clan membership , with a z score of 6.00 standard deviation units or above considered to be statistically significant . For peptidases , other evidence to indicate that families are related when a tertiary structure is absent includes the same order of catalytic residues in the sequences .
