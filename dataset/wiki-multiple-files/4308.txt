It is a left tributary of the Lauter which , here in its upper reaches is still called the ' ' Wieslauter ' ' . # Geography # # Course # The Erlenbach has a main source and a rather smaller subsidiary source , which are only a few hundred metres from one another on the eastern flank of the 445-metre-high Lffelsberg . They are located in the Wasgau , which comprises the southern part of the Palatinate Forest and the adjoining northern part of the French Vosges Mountains . Initially the stream flows eastwards passing through the parish of Oberschlettenbach , its two headstreams meeting after 2 km , the smaller brook emptying from the right into the bigger one . The combined Erlenbach swings south and passes the villages of Vorderweidenthal and Erlenbach . In Niederschlettenbach it discharges into the Wieslauter from the left . # Tributaries # *Wstenborn ( ' ' right ' ' ) *Kleisterbach ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ' ' right ' ' ) *Eisenbach ( ' ' right ' ' ) , 1.4 km # Sights # ; Wildlife park , Lindelbrunn Castle Immediately east of the source area lies the Sdliche Weinstrae Wildlife Park and the castle of Lindelbrunn . ; Drachenfels Castle Drachenfels Castle , 3 km west of the middle reaches of the stream , was destroyed in 1523 , because part of it had belonged to the rebel knight Francis of Sickingen . ; Berwartstein Castle The Berwartstein , still occupied and managed today , was once the possession of the knight , Hans von Trotha who , as ' ' Hans Trapp ' ' has been absorbed into local legend .
