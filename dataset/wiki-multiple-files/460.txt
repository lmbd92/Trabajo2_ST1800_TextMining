She was built in 1986 by Wrtsil Helsinki Shipyard , Finland , for Effoa as MS ' ' Wellamo ' ' for use on Silja Line traffic . She was rebuilt in 1992 at Lloyds Werft , Bremerhaven , Germany as ' ' Silja Festival ' ' . In 2008 the ship was transferred from the Silja Line fleet to that of Tallink , but she retained her Silja-prefixed name . Since May 6th 2013 , the ship is laid up awaiting a decision for her future . # History # # Wellamo # Following the delivery of the highly successful MS ' ' Finlandia ' ' and MS ' ' Silvia Regina ' ' for Silja Line 's HelsinkiStockholm service , Johnson Line and Effoa decided to order a pair of ships based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new ships , named MS ' ' Svea ' ' , was delivered to Johnson Line in May 1985 . The ship built for Effoa was given the name MS ' ' Wellamo ' ' ( after the goddess of the sea in Finnish mythology , a traditional name in Effoa fleet ) and delivered in January 1986 . Following delivery she was placed on the StockholmMariehamnTurku route . The Wellamo suffered her first major mishap in July of the same year when she suffered a blackout and was grounded near Mariahamn . Following the grounding she was repaired at Luonnonmaan Telakka , Naantali , Finland . In 1989 plans were made for converting the ship to a combined car/passenger/train ferry , but these were abandoned . In the summer of 1990 the Wellamo briefly served on the HelsinkiStockholm route , because the new ' ' Silja Serenade ' ' was not yet complete , but old MS ' ' Finlandia ' ' had to be delivered to her new owners DFDS . During the same year Effoa and Johnson Line merged to form EffJohn , who now became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EffJohn planned a large-scale reconstruction of GTS ' ' Finnjet ' ' . However the company could not gather enough funds to realise this project . Instead the money was used to rebuild the Svea and Wellamo . In 1992 , Wellamo was docked and rebuild at Lloyds Werft , Bremerhaven , Germany . Most notable exterior changes were a new skybar in front of the funnel and a new , more blue-dominated livery . Following the reconstruction the Wellamo was renamed MS ' ' Silja Festival ' ' ( her sister having become MS ' ' Silja Karneval ' ' ) . Around the same time her homeport was changed from Helsinki to Mariehamn. # Silja Festival # Initially the ' ' Silja Festival ' ' continued on the same route as before , alongside her sister , but following the acquisition of MS ' ' Silja Europa ' ' and the subsequent fleet re-organisation there was no longer a need for the ship on the Turku route . As a result was placed on the VaasaUme route from 20 March to 23 May 1993 .

From there on the service was maketed as Silja Line Euroway . A few months later the route was extended to Copenhagen . After the Euroway service was terminated in April 1994 , ' ' Silja Festival ' ' was moved back to the Kvarken to operate from Vaasa to Ume and Sundsvall . Around this time Silja Line made an agreement to sell ' ' Silja Festival ' ' or her sistership ' ' Silja Karneval ' ' to Norwegian ferry operator Color Line . Although ' ' Silja Karneval ' ' was the ship finally sold to Color , the new owners had presumed they 'd be getting ' ' Festival ' ' and had made promotional posters for their new ship accordingly . As a result the Silja Karneval was confusingly renamed MS ' ' Color Festival ' ' . In 2 September 1994 , ' ' Silja Festival ' ' was moved from Vaasa to serve the HelsinkiTallinn route .

The ' ' Silja Festival ' ' was replaced on the TurkuStockholm service by on 23 July 2008 . Subsequently the ' ' Silja Festival ' ' was moved to the Latvian ship registry , repainted with Tallink logos , and entered service on Tallink 's StockholmRiga route on 2 August 2008 . Despite being moved under the Tallink brand and marketed as Festival , the ship 's registered name remained as ' ' Silja Festival ' ' . On April 5th 2013 , Tallink announced the purchase of Viking Lines ferry MS Isabella which then replaced MS Silja Festival on the Stockholm-Riga route on May 6th , 2013 .
