These locomotives were designed under the supervision of E. C. Bredin with his Chief Draughtsman , H. J. A. Beaumont , preparing the drawings . They were the largest and most powerful engines ever to run in Ireland by quite a large margin . # Design # The engines had three cylinders and boiler pressure . The nominal tractive effort was , which corresponded with Great British main-line power . Further , it was the only design which exploited the full extent of the extra width afforded by the gauge . Originally four or five were to be built , named ' ' ' ' , ' ' ' ' , ' ' Tilte ' ' , ' ' Grinne ' ' , and ' ' Deirdre ' ' , but only three were eventually turned out - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ' ( 801 ) and ' ' Tailt ' ' ( 802 ) in 1940 , along with a fourth boiler which acted as a spare . They were intended for the DublinCork route but wartime coal shortages and the early 1950s advent of diesels on main line services resulted in their never having had much chance to show what they were capable of . In the 1950s they gradually became neglected and even resorted to light goods trains on occasion , with little other work to do . The name and number plates were of cast bronze with polished raised lettering and beading on a blue painted background . The nameplates lattering was in Gaelic script using dot above in place of the ' h ' ( see Irish orthography ) , although at first locomotive 800 carried an Anglicised name ' ' Maeve ' ' in roman type . No. 800 ' ' ' ' was withdrawn from service in 1962 and is now on display at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum , Cultra , Northern Ireland . # Livery # The locos were turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever carried . In the height of the Great Southern era , when every single locomotive in Ireland wore a plain unlined battleship grey livery , these engines were turned out in a smart mid green , with a distinct bluish tint . The green was lined in black and light yellow , and the GSR coat of arms was carried on the tender , flanked by large pale yellow letters G S , which appear to have been shaded in red and gold . The cabside number plates and nameplates had blue backgrounds , and raised polished brass rims and numerals . In Cras Iompair ireann days they received the 1950s standard green , somewhat darker than they had carried before , with black and white lining . This is the livery the preserved 800 carries , though rather than the CI Flying snail emblem which would be appropriate to this later livery , it incorrectly carries the earlier G S without shading , and a replaced GSR coat of arms . # Model # An etched brass 4mm scale model is available from . This comes complete with nickel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both OO and 21mm gauge versions can be made .
