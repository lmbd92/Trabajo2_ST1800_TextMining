@@217514 Mary Baker ( ne Willcocks ) ( 1791 24 December 1864 ) was a noted impostor who went by the name Princess Caraboo . She pretended to be from a far off island kingdom and fooled a British town for some months . # Biography # On 3 April 1817 , a cobbler in Almondsbury in Gloucestershire , England , met an apparently disoriented young woman wearing exotic clothes who was speaking an incomprehensible language . The cobbler 's wife took this stranger to the Overseer of the Poor , who placed her in the hands of the local county magistrate , Samuel Worrall , who lived in on the estate where Tower House is located . Worrall and his American-born wife Elizabeth could not understand her either ; what they did determine was that she called herself Caraboo and that she was interested in Chinese imagery . They sent her to the local inn , where she identified a drawing of a pineapple with the word ' ananas ' , meaning pineapple in many Indo-European languages , and insisted on sleeping on the floor . Samuel Worrall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristol and tried for vagrancy . During her imprisonment , a Portuguese sailor named Manuel Eynesso ( or Enes ) said he spoke her language and translated her story . According to Enes , she was Princess Caraboo from the island of Javasu in the Indian Ocean . She had been captured by pirates and after a long voyage she had jumped overboard in the Bristol Channel and swam ashore . The Worralls brought Caraboo to their home . For ten weeks , this representative of exotic royalty was a favourite of the local dignitaries . She used a bow and arrow , fenced , swam naked and prayed to a god , whom she named Alla-Tallah . She acquired exotic clothing and her portrait was painted and reproduced in local newspapers . Her authenticity was attested to by a Dr Wilkinson , who identified her language using Edmund Fry 's ' ' Pantographia ' ' and stated that marks on the back of her head were the work of oriental surgeons . Eventually the truth surfaced . A boarding-house keeper , Mrs. Neale , recognised her from the picture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosts . This would-be princess was in truth a cobbler 's daughter , Mary Baker ( ne Willcocks ) from Witheridge , Devon . She had been a servant girl around England but had found no place to stay . She invented her fictitious language from imaginary and gypsy words and created an exotic character and story . The odd marks on her head were scars from a crude cupping operation in a poorhouse hospital in London . The British press had a field day at the expense of the duped rustic middle-class . Her hosts arranged for her to travel to Philadelphia and she departed 28 June 1817 . On 13 September 1817 a letter was printed in the ' ' Bristol Journal ' ' , allegedly from Sir Hudson Lowe , the official in charge of the exiled Emperor Napoleon on St. Helena . It claimed that after the Philadelphia-bound ship bearing the beautiful Caraboo had been driven close to the island by a tempest , the intrepid princess impulsively cut herself adrift in a small boat , rowed ashore and so fascinated the emperor that he was applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That story is unverified . In the USA , she briefly continued her role , appearing on-stage at the Washington Hall , Philadelphia , as ' Princess Caraboo ' , with little success . Her last contact with the Worralls was in a letter from New York in November 1817 , in which she complained of her notoriety . She appears to have returned to Philadelphia until she left America in 1824 , returning to England . In 1824 she returned to Britain and exhibited herself for a short time in New Bond Street , London , as ' Princess Caraboo ' but her act was not successful . She may have briefly travelled to France and Spain in her guise , but soon returned to England . In September 1828 , she was living as a widow in Bedminster under the name Mary Burgess ( in reality the name of a cousin ) . There she married Richard Baker , and gave birth to a daughter the following year . In 1839 , she was selling leeches to the Bristol Infirmary Hospital .
