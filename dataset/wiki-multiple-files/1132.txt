@@6274514 Berissa ( also spelled ' ' Berisa ' ' or ' ' Verissa ' ' ) is a Roman Catholic titular see in the former Roman province of Pontus Polemoniacus , in Asia Minor , which Kiepert and W. M. Ramsay have identified with the modern village of Baulus ( also known as ' ' Bolus ' ' ) , south-west of Tokat. # Ecclesiastical History # In the time of St. Basil it was included in the diocese of Ibora , as appears from letters LXXXVI and LXXXVII of the great bishop , but soon after became an independent bishopric in Armenia Prima , with Sebasteia as metropolis . This important change took place before 458 , when its bishop , Maxentius ( written wrongly Ausentius ) , subscribed with his colleagues of Armenia Prima the synodal letter to the Emperor Leo I ( Mansi , XII , 587-589 ) . Hierocles , at the beginning of the sixth century , does not treat it as an independent city ; but it is mentioned as such by Justinian in a Novella of 536 , among the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor , when creating the province of Armenia Quarta in 536 , gave to Armenia Prima the name of Armenia Secunda , without altering the established ecclesiastical organization , so that Berissa remained a suffragan see of Sebasteia . Among its later bishops may be mentioned Thomas , who was present at the fifth ecumenical council at Constantinople , in 553 ( Mansi , IX , 175 ) , and another at the sixth in 680 ( ibid. , XI , 66 ) . It appears still later in the ' ' Notitiae Episcopatuum ' ' as suffragan to Sebasteia , and its name is written sometimes ' ' Berisse ' ' or ' ' Berisse ' ' ; Merisse and Kerisse are merely palaeographical mistakes . Berissa was a Latin bishopric as late as the fifteenth century , when Paul II appointed the Franciscan Libertus de Broehun to succeed the deceased bishop , John ( Wadding , Annales Minorum , VI , 708 ) .
