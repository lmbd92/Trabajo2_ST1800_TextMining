@@19300514 Stevie Riks ( born 3 September 1967 ) is a British comedian and impressionist . He mainly releases material via the Internet video viewing web site ' ' YouTube ' ' . He took part in Central Television 's ' ' New Faces ' ' in 1988 and has featured on the BBC television magazine programme ' ' Inside Out ' ' . Riks ' specialities are impersonations of musicians from the 1960s and 1970s although he has branched off into other areas such as impersonating football personalities . Based in Chester , England , he records his comic video sketches in his home with a digital camera . He often uses split screen technology to perform dual roles . Apart from performing various accents such as Cockney and Liverpudlian , Elvis Presley 's typical slur and imitating typical facial tics and mannerisms , Riks is the first impersonator to imitate all members of the Beatles , The Bee Gees , The Rolling Stones and Queen . His singing voice is notable for its range , from David Bowie 's low crooning timbre in Wild is the Wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of avoiding infringement of copyright ( which cost him his YouTube account twice ) is to subtly change the lyrics of famous pop songs or to imitate the way pop celebrities talk and demonstrate droll dance steps ( Bowie , Freddie Mercury , Cliff Richard ) or even cook as in George Harrison Makes A Curry . In this capacity , Riks has been making a come-back with a new YouTube account from 3 August 2009 onwards , which has been viewed over 13,000 times in a fortnight . A recent gimmick has been the sudden appearance of various rock stars in videos of songs they never performed in the first place for comic effect , or odd pairings such as Elvis Presley with David Bowie . # Notable Impressions # *John Lennon *Paul McCartney *George Harrison *Ringo Starr *Ray Davies *Dave Davies *Noel Gallagher *Liam Gallagher *Marc Bolan *Freddie Mercury *Brian May *Roger Meddows-Taylor *Mick Jagger *Keith Richards *Ronnie Wood *Charlie Watts *Eric Clapton *Elvis Presley *David Bowie *Elvis Costello *Michael Jackson *David Cassidy *Art Garfunkel *Paul Simon *Bing Crosby *Bob Dylan *Elton John *Cliff Richard *Barry Gibb *Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Ozzy Osbourne *Sting *Gilbert O'Sullivan *David Essex *George Formby *Donovan *Gerry Marsden *Tom Jones *Paul O'Grady *George Michael *Davy Jones *Micky Dolenz *Michael Nesmith *George Best # References # <references/> *
