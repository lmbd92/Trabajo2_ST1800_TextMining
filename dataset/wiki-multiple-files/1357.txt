@@8235514 Rlinda Kett is a fictional character from the ' Saga of Seven Suns ' series of novels by Kevin J. Anderson . # Biography # Rlinda Kett was a trader and was once the head of a group of five trader ships that were reduced to four with the capture of the ' ' Great Expectations ' ' by Roamer pirate Rand Sorengaard and the execution of the captain Gabriel Mesta . Kett was on board the EDF capital ship in the Yreka system when the pirates were brought to justice , one of her five ex-husbands and trader ship captains Branson Roberts serving as the bait that drew out the Roamers . Although she hated Rand Sorengaard and his comrades Kett still thought the punishment handed out by Kurt Lanyan was too harsh . Before the onset of the war against the hydrogues Rlinda Kett travelled to Theroc to talk with the commercially minded Sarein about the possibility of trade between the Therons and the Terran Hanseatic League . Kett 's desire to tap into the market for Theron food and textiles was nearly ruined by Sarein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green priests however Rlinda did still acquire a large cargo of Theron goods . These items were largely bought up by the then Prime Designate Jora'h and consequently other Ildirans after Rlinda transported them as well as the green priests Otema and Nira to Ildira . Rlinda 's fleet was further reduced to the single ship ' ' Voracious Curiosity ' ' when the rest of her ships were commandeered by the EDF for the war against the hydrogues . With the restriction of ekti by the Terran Hanseatic League , Rlinda was also confined to a landing field on the Moon despite her inability to pay the fee . However , Rlinda did receive a message from her favourite ex-husband informing her he was deserting the EDF and fleeing to Crenna . Basil Wenceslas spared Rlinda Kett a continued stay on the Moon as he needed someone to take his agent Davlin Lotze to Rheindic Co to search for the missing xenoarchaeologists Louis and Margaret Colicos . This assignment required Rlinda to pick up Lotze at the former Ildiran world of Crenna , where she was reunited with Branson Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co Rlinda trekked around with Davlin Lotze for a while until the exosociologist stepped through a reactivated Klikiss transportal and vanished . Although concerned for Davlin Lotze , Rlinda Kett did not travel through the portal herself but instead stayed on Rheindic Co to wait for Lotze 's return . This decision likely saved Lotze 's life as he did return to Rheindic Co some days later , and the pair set off back to Earth so that Davlin could report the transportal system and its colonisation potential to Basil Wenceslas . Due to the colonisation initiative that was started because of Davlin Lotze 's discovery , Rlinda Kett was employed to transport heavy machinery too big to be transferred through the Klikiss portals to old Klikiss worlds . After talking to Basil Wenceslas Rlinda also got Branson Roberts involved in the initiative - despite General Kurt Lanyan 's belief that all deserters were traitors - and the Chairman promised not to report the man to the General but said that he could not protect him if he was found out . While carrying machinery to Corribus , Rlinda Kett and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested their assistance in evacuating the population of Crenna . The trio succeeded in this mission although they were not warmly received back on Relleker . Rlinda stayed on the planet for a while before taking a shipload of refugees back to Earth , and consequently discovering that Branson Roberts - who had departed Relleker earlier to complete the delivery to Corribus - had been arrested for desertion . Rlinda failed to defend Branson Roberts despite her best efforts but did fly off from Mars on board the ' ' Voracious Curiosity ' ' with Branson Roberts after Davlin Lotze succeeded in freeing the pilot . Chased by EDF remoras , Rlinda took her ship to a far flung star system after witnessing the destruction of ' ' Blind Faith ' ' which had been piloted by Davlin Lotze but was tracked to the area by EDF forces . To escape capture Rlinda dived into the atmosphere of the system 's gas giant and circle the world only to be captured by Roamers from one of the icy moons of the gas giant . # Appearances/ Sources # * Hidden Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suns
