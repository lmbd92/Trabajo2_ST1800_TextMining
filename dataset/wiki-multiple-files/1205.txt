The hospital was the result of the successful lobbying efforts of 19th century social reformer , Dorothea Dix . A nine member board of trustees was empowered to appoint a superintendent , purchase land , and construct facilities near Harrisburg . This board of trustees received no compensation for their work . In 1848 , the name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50,000 was appropriated to begin construction . Patients from all parts of the state would be accepted at the hospital , at the expense of the counties that they belonged ; or , if able they would pay for themselves at a cost of $2.50 per week . This cost included board and medical attention . Originally the hospital only had one building which housed the administration , staff , and patients . Built in 1851 , the Main Building was designed following the Kirkbride Plan which was a very popular building style during the late 19th century . The original capacity of the building was 250 patients , but was later expanded with the removal of dining rooms and the addition of the North and South Branch Buildings . A 130 acre farm was located adjacent to the hospital and provided work therapy for the patients and also enabled the hospital to be self-supporting , by growing its own food , and raising its own livestock . When the first patient was admitted on October 6 , 1851 , every poor district was charged a $2.00 weekly maintenance fee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for private patients were scheduled to vary between $3.00 and $10.00 based upon ability to pay . In 1869 the Board of Public Charities was created to inspect all public and voluntary charitable institutions in the Commonwealth and to report to the legislature with recommendations concerning their operation . For four decades this unpaid Board and its small staff had no authority to correct the conditions it found within state institutions . Nonetheless , by persuasion and publicity they were able to improve the quality of care in public institutions . A major objective was the removal of the insane from almshouses to the Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital and other state hospitals . A Committee on Lunacy was created within the Board of Public charities in 1883 to oversee the operations of these mental institutions . The early 20th century was a time of great change for Harrisburg State Hospital . The Main Building had become old and was in need of replacement . Between the years 1893 and 1912 the hospital was rebuilt following the Cottage Plan , which became popular at the beginning of the 20th century . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 buildings . Designed and constructed by Pennsylvania architects Addison Hutton and John A. Dempwolf the campus and buildings were meant to represent an Italianate window . The buildings on the male and female sides of the campus mirrored each other until the addition of new buildings in the 1930s . In 1921 the name of the hospital was changed to the Harrisburg State Hospital . Also that year , the Board of Public Charities was abolished and the Department of Public Welfare was created to administer all state hospitals . With the completion of the new Cottage Plan buildings , the hospital had grown considerably larger . Its patient capacity was 2,019 , but at one time it held as many as 2,441 with 437 on parole . The hospital was self-sufficient with its own farm , power plant , and stores ; it became known as the City on the Hill . During war time there was a 50% shortage of attendants , at the lowest level of employment there were as few as one nurse to 166 patients . In June 1945 only 26 of the 92 authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage resulted in widespread curtailment of services to both the public and patients . Up until 1955 certain administrative responsibilities , such as the selection of the hospital Superintendent and the enactment of rules and regulations governing the hospital were vested in the Board of Trustees of the Harrisburg State Hospital . In 1955 an amendment to the Administrative Code authorized the Department of Public Welfare to assume administrative responsibilities for the Harrisburg State Hospital , relegating its Board of Trustees to specific advisory duties . This act also provided for the appointment of a Commissioner of Mental Health in the Department of Public Welfare who assumed overall responsibility for Pennsylvania 's mental health program . Like other institutions Harrisburg State Hospitals patient population began to fall in the late 20th century . This was due to new medicines being developed and finally deinstitutionalization . The hospital was finally closed on January 27 , 2006 . Today ( 2008 ) the hospital sits on a 200 acre campus with stately buildings in a country setting , in Dauphin County , with a majority of its campus in Susquehanna Township .
