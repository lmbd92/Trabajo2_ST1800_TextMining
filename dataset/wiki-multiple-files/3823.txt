MAARC has thrived and today is an active club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after MAARCs founding , club members began exploring the possibility of creating a museum to share their interest in vintage radio with the general public . Several possibilities were investigated but it became clear that to be successful , a separate organization dedicated to the task of creating and operating a museum has to be established . The resulting Radio &amp; Television Museum ( R&amp;T Museum ) operated by the Radio History Society , Inc. ( now the National Capital Radio &amp; Television Museum NCRTV Museum ) is a Maryland non-profit corporation established in 1993 for the express purpose of creating a museum of radio and television . R&amp;T Museum sought and received IRS 501(c) ( 3 ) nonprofit status . Starting with no building , no funds , no collection , and only a handful of dedicated volunteers , the Museum began by borrowing artifacts from local radio collectors and mounting temporary exhibits in several of the regions public libraries , downtown at the George Washington University , and at the City Place Mall in Silver Spring , Maryland . Efforts sought an affordable building in which to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century-old former farmhouse in Bowie , Maryland , that was owned and had been refurbished by the City of Bowie . The fully restored building is located at the intersection of Mitchellville and Mount Oak Roads , located just off of Route 50 and the D.C. Beltway , east of Washington , D.C. After a visit , the Museum leadership determined it might be suitable for creation of a museum . The Societys officers made a presentation to the Bowie City Council , after which the city manager agreed to a long-term lease agreement with the Society . In March 1999 a long-term lease agreement for the Radio &amp; Television Museum was signed by then-president Ed Walker and the City of Bowie . The Museum opened its doors to the public in June 1999 , and celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2009 . In recent years it became increasingly evident that the two entities Radio History Society and the Radio &amp; Television Museum were confusing . Consequently , in 2011 the board determined to change the organization name to National Capital Radio &amp; Television Museum , doing away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name change was publicly announced on May 9 , 2012 . In addition , the board brought on its first paid professional staff in mid-2011 . This mutually beneficial public-private partnership continues today . The building and grounds continue to be maintained by the city , while NCRTV operates the museum . In other partnering , the Museum also has developed exhibits at the George Washington University ( since 2001 ) , and at the Library of American Broadcasting at the University of Maryland . Recently it is partnering with the Prince George 's County Memorial Library System to present regularly scheduled programs .
