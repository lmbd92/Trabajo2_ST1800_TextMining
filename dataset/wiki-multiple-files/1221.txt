@@7018514 Although the U.S. Mint maintains that there is no widely accepted and standardized numismatic industry definition of first strike coins , First Strike coins definitely exist in the coin industry . Still , they are recent developments , having been first promoted in 2005 . The most frequently promoted First Strike coins are American Gold Eagle coins , American Silver Eagle coins , American Platinum Eagle coins , and the new American Gold Buffalo coins . One often seen definition of First Strike coins calls them the first coins struck from a new set of dies . Another calls them near-perfect specimens produced within the first few hundred strikings in an edition . The U.S. Mint 's production and distribution practices challenge both definitions . The U.S. Mint does not track the order in which it mints coins during their production and does not segregate or specifically identify the first coins minted from a set of dies . The Mint produces up to fifty percent of the projected sales of new coins weeks prior to their release . Further , the Mint does not necessarily ship coins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible for promoters of First Strike coins to know that the coins being promoted as First Strike are actually the first coins struck from a new set of dies . The numbering on the boxes of coins shipped from the Mint are for accounting and inventory purposes only and do not reflect the order in which the coins were minted . No U.S. Mint First Strike Program The U.S. Mint has no First Strike program for the minting and distribution of its coins . However , the Mint sometimes does first strikings of new coins , but the first strikings are ceremonial and usually consist of only two coins , which are not set aside but are put into the regular inventory of the new coins . It is probably from these ceremonial strikings that promoters came up the idea of First Strike coins . PCGS and NGC First Strike Coins The premier coin grading services that grade First Strike coins are Professional Coin Grading Service ( PCGS ) and NGC ( Numismatic Guaranty Corporation ) . These two firms ' positions on First Strike coins more clearly explain what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discuss First Strike coins , but does post the U.S. Mint 's position . However , the NGC website designates as First Strike those coins that were shipped from the U.S. Mint within the first month of their official release . PCGS says that for coins to be labeled First Strike , they must be received within thirty days of commencement of shipping ( or have documentation that proves that the coins were shipped during the first thirty days of a coin 's production . ) NGC does not assert that the coins eligible to be labeled First Strike are among the first coins struck but are coins shipped within the first month of release . Further , NGC includes in the First Strike category coins of early or first release . A general term for these coins is first strikes . In reality , the NGC position on First Strike coins offers the best definition : coins of early or first release . While First Strike coins may be from the first strikings of a new set of dies , in reality there is no way for graders or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are promoting were from the first strikes of new dies . First Strike Not Trademarked Some websites maintain that PCGS trademarked First Strike . However , a search of the U.S. Patent Office 's website does not evidence that , and a search of the PGCS website did not find any claim of having trademarked First Strike . NGC asserts there is no trademark for First Strike and that it is a generic term in the coin industry .
