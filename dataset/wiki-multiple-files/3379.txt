Zimmer had long praised Powell 's abilities , and on many occasions , asserted that he was the superior composer between them , thus firmly supporting Powell 's first solo animation effort . For the score , Powell utilized many Celtic influences , employing instruments like the fiddle , bagpipes , dulcimer , pennywhistle , and even a harpsichord . Icelandic singer Jnsi was brought on to write and record the song Sticks &amp; Stones , which plays during the end credits of the film . In an interview with ' ' The Wrap s Steve Pond , Powell talked about his intent for the score : I was certainly trying to get a bit more epic . I just felt the animation and the visuals were giving me a broader palette to play with .
