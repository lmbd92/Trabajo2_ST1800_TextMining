It was held on December 1 , 1926 , to elect the 112 Members of the 17th Legislative Assembly of Ontario ( MLAs ) . The Ontario Conservative Party , led by George Howard Ferguson , was re-elected for a second term in government , despite losing a few seats in the Legislative Assembly . The principal issue of the campaign was the government 's proposal to repeal the ' ' Ontario Temperance Act ' ' and replace prohibition with government control of liquor sales . The Opposition Liberal and Progressive parties both campaigned against repeal and one of Ferguson 's ministers , William Folger Nickle , resigned from the cabinet and ran for re-election against the government as a Prohibitionist candidate . The Ontario Liberal Party , led by W.E.N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Farmers of Ontario in the previous election , the farmers organization decided to withdraw from electoral politics and most UFO MPPs redesignated themselves as Progressives with former UFO Attorney-General William Edgar Raney becoming party leader . Nevertheless , several MPPs , including Raney himself , continued to run as candidates endorsed by local UFO associations despite the decision of the organization as a whole not to run in elections . The Progressive/UFO faction won 13 seats . As well , four Liberal-Progressive candidates were elected , along with various independents . Karl Homuth of Waterloo South was the only Labour MLA returned ; a former UFO-Labour MLA , he would run as a Conservative in the 1929 election . # Results # border= 1 cellpadding= 4 cellspacing= 0 style= border-collapse : collapse border-color : #444444 ! rowspan= 2 ! rowspan= 2 Party ! rowspan= 2 Leader ! rowspan= 2 align= center Elected ! rowspan= 2 align= center % change ! colspan=2 align= center Popular vote Notes : <nowiki> * </nowiki> Party did not nominate candidates in previous election .
