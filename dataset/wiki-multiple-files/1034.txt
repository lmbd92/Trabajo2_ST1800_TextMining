@@5564514 Andrea Brustolon ( 20 July 1662 &amp;ndash ; 25 October 1732 ) was an Italian sculptor in wood . He is known for his furnishings in the Baroque style and devotional sculptures . # Biography # He was trained in a vigorous local tradition of sculpture in his native Belluno , in the Venetian ' ' terraferma ' ' , and in the studio of the Genoese sculptor Filippo Parodi , who was carrying out commissions at Padua and at Venice ( 1677 ) . He spent the years 1678-80 at Rome , where the High Baroque sculpture of Bernini and his contemporaries polished his style . Apart from that , the first phase of Brustolon 's working career was spent in Venice , 1680&amp;ndash ; 1685 . Brustolon is documented at several Venetian churches where he executed decorative carving in such profusion that he must have quickly assembled a large studio of assistants . As with his contemporary in London , Grinling Gibbons almost all the high quality robust Baroque carving in Venice has been attributed to Brustolon at one time or another .

His furniture included armchairs with figural sculptures that take the place of front legs and armrest supports , inspired by his experience of Bernini 's ' ' Cathedra Petri ' ' . The gueridon , a tall stand for a candelabrum , offered Brustolon unhampered possibilities for variations of the idea of a caryatid or atlas : the familiar Baroque painted and ebonized blackamoor gueridons , endlessly reproduced since the eighteenth century , found their models in Brustolon 's work . His secular commissions from Pietro Venier , of the Venier di San Vio family ( a suite of forty sculptural pieces that can be seen in the ' ' Sala di Brustolon ' ' of the Ca ' Rezzonico , Venice ) , from the Pisani of Str , and from the Correr di San Simeone families encourage the attribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brustolon 's elaborate carved furniture aspired towards the condition of sculpture , such as the Dutch bases for console tables which look like enlargements of the work of the two Van Vianens , Paulus and Adam , perhaps the greatest Dutch silversmiths of the period . These carved pieces display the baroque tendency to develop a form three-dimensionally in space . Brustolon 's walnut , boxwood and ebony pieces transcend ordinary functional limitations of furniture ; they are constructed of elaborately carved figures . The framework of Brustolon 's chairs , side tables and gueridons were carved as gnarled tree branches , with further supports of putti and moors carved in ebony . Backrests of the chairs , which were never touched in the rigidly upright posture that contemporary etiquette demanded , were carved with allegories of vanity , fire and music , etc . The most extravagant piece delivered for Pietro Venier was a large side table and vase-stand of box and ebony , designed as a single ensemble to display rare imported Japanese porcelain vases . The eclectic allegories include Hercules with the Hydra and Cerberus , moors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correr , less extrovert chairs bear female nudes extended along the armrests . For the Pisani , he carved a suite of twelve chairs ( now at the Palazzo Quirinale ) with flowers , fruit , leaves and branches to symbolize the twelve months of the year . Work by Brustolon is at the Villa Pisani at Stra . In 1685 Brustolon returned to the house where he was born at Belluno , and from that time devoted himself mainly to tabernacles and devotional sculptures in walnut , boxwood or ivory . His polychromed ivory ' ' Corpus ' ' from a crucifix is in the Museo Civico di Belluno , which preserves some of Brustolon 's preparatory drawings for frames to be carved with putti displaying emblems . A pair of boxwood sculptures , ' ' The Sacrifice of Abraham ' ' and ' ' Jacob Wrestling with the Angel ' ' , integral with scrolling ' ' barocchetto ' ' stands , were in the collection of Justus Liebig ( Liebigshaus , Frankfort ) .

The Venetian sculptor Valentino Panciera Besarel ( 1829&amp;ndash ; 1902 ) made upholstered armchairs in the Brustolon manner from the 1860s
