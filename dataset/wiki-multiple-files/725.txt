@@3150514 ' ' Long-Haired Hare ' ' is a Warner Brothers Looney Tunes theatrical cartoon short released in 1949 , directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese . In addition to including the homophones hair and hare , the title is also a pun on longhairs , a characterization of classical music lovers . Nicolai Shutorov provides the singing voice of Giovanni Jones . # Plot # Bugs is happily minding his own business , playing a banjo and singing A Rainy Night in Rio . Nearby , a burly , blond-haired opera singer named Giovanni Jones rehearses Largo al Factotum from ' ' The Barber of Seville ' ' . Overhearing Bugs , he absent-mindedly finds himself singing along in operatic style : What do they do in Mississippi when skies are drippy ? . Realizing that he accidentally switched genres , Giovanni loses his temper over his rehearsal being interrupted in this manner . Giovanni angrily confronts Bugs and breaks the banjo strings and the banjo itself in half , crushing the neck and then slamming the body over Bugs ' head . ( Music-hater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he hears Bugs singing My Gal Is a High-Born Lady and playing a harp . He tries to ignore Bugs , but again ends up singing and dancing along : one and two and three and four , she dances all day long . Giovanni angrily confronts Bugs once again . He grabs Bugs by the throat , puts him in the harp , and crushes his neck inside the harp like a vise . ( Also a rabbit-hater , Bugs counters . ) As Giovanni tries to sing again later , the sound of a Sousaphone seems to come out of his mouth . The sound is coming from Bugs playing When Yuba Plays the Rhumba on the Tuba . Though the rabbit promptly ducks into his hole , Giovanni reaches down into the Sousaphone , pulls him out , ties him by his ears to a tree branch , and yanks him down so that he bounces up and down beneath the branch , bonking his head repeatedly . As Giovanni walks away , an enraged Bugs decides its time for payback , and says his famous line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' means war ! Bugs exacts his revenge against Giovanni though a series of public humiliations during his concert ( seemingly at the Hollywood Bowl ) . First , Bugs vibrates the roof of the concert hall to disrupt the singer 's vocals . Then he hammers it so Giovanni moves across the stage and falls and gets trapped into a tuba . Bugs pulls him out and takes him backstage . Next Bugs sprays Giovanni 's throat with liquid alum which shrinks his head as well his voice . Next , Bugs dresses up as a teenage bobby soxer and asks Giovanni for an autograph , only the pen is a stick of dynamite . After the off-screen explosion , Giovanni steps out to the stage with a singed face and evening wear torn to shreds . He takes a couple of bows and then collapses . During the concert 's final act , Bugs poses as the highly respected Leopold Stokowski to take over the conducting duties , even breaking the baton and using his hands instead .

His face turns different colors as he squirms and unravels his formal wear . Bugs leaves his glove hovering in the air and steps outside to order a pair of earmuffs which are delivered instantly after Bugs places the order in the mailbox . Bugs returns to the stage to find Giovanni has obeyed the glove and is still singing the high note but is now thrashing about on the floor banging his fists , his face still turning various colors . Finally , the top of the concert hall 's shell shatters and tumbles down on top of Giovanni . For the encore , a roughed-up Giovanni ( whose hair is now reddish ) appears out of the rubble to take a bow . Witnessing one last piece of the amphitheater balanced on a steel beam above Giovanni , Bugs again cues the singer to close out his performance with the high note so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satisfied with his victory , Bugs removes his wig and ends the performance by playing the Vaudeville-era four-note tune , Good Evening Friends , on a banjo. # Music # The film 's musical score includes original music by Carl Stalling , but a significant proportion of the score is pre-existing music , including several operatic pieces . The soundtrack includes Gioachino Rossini 's ' ' Largo al factotum ' ' from The Barber of Seville ; Arthur Schwartz 's ' ' A Rainy Night in Rio ' ' ; Barney Fagan 's ' ' My Gal is a High-Born Lady ' ' ; Herman Hupfeld 's song ' ' When Yuba Plays the Rumba on the Tuba ' ' played by Bugs on a tuba ; Gaetano Donizetti 's aria ' ' Chi Mi Frena In Tal Momento ' ' from Donizetti 's Lucia di Lammermoor ; Richard Wagner 's prelude , 2nd theme from Act III of Lohengrin ; Franz von Supp 's overture from Die schne Galathee ; and the melody to It 's Magic . This last piece is also used in the cartoon ' ' Transylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racially stereotyped subject and lyrics . The author of the re-written lyrics used in the cartoon might be Carl Stalling or Michael Maltese . The Donizetti piece , actually a sextet , seems to have been a favorite of Warner music arranger Carl Stalling , and is also used in ' ' Book Revue ' ' and ' ' Back Alley Oproar ' ' . Giovanni Jones ' singing voice remained uncredited and unknown for many years . It was since revealed to have been provided by baritone Nicolai G. Shutorev ( 1914-1948 ) . That is noted in the commentary voice-over provided on the DVD . Also noted on the DVD commentary is Bugs Bunny 's conducting performance as Leopold , as a send-up of conductor Leopold Stokowski 's energetic style , including his shunning the baton : Bugs makes a point of snapping the baton in half and discarding it . As Bugs enters the concert hall wearing a Stokowski-like hairpiece , the orchestra members begin whispering among themselves , Leopold ! Leopold ! The DVD commentator also notes that Stokowski conducted many performances at the Hollywood Bowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though Stokowski was , at the time , one of the best known conductors in the world , the most famous film in which he appeared , ' ' Fantasia ' ' ( 1940 ) , was an embarrassment to Warner Brothers ' rival Walt Disney Productions that did not earn back its cost until 1970. # Analysis # According to Daniel Goldmark , the first two minutes of the cartoon establish a struggle between classical music and popular music . Giovanni acts as if protecting the world of good music from the ignorant masses which Bugs represents . The folk melodies which Bugs sings are features as infectious and treated as disease by Giovanni , acting as a representative of the musical establishment . Each time that Giovanni finds himself singing to one of Bugs ' songs , his first reaction is shock , followed by fury that he is wasting his voice on less refined music . Goldmark finds similarities with ' ' The Band Concert ' ' ( 1935 ) , where Donald Duck insists on playing ' ' Turkey in the Straw ' ' and infuriates Mickey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his initial choice of musical organ , the banjo . Secondly , he performs in a backwoods setting , as opposed to Giovanni 's modern house . Thirdly , he sings from memory while Giovanni uses sheet music . He is also implied to be an untrained musician , contrasting with the trained Giovanni . A further contrast is implied through the geographic origin of their songs . Bugs sings American popular songs , while Giovanni ' repertoire is Western European in origin . The orchestral musicians featured in the short have little to no personality . Their identity depends only on their instrument . Chuck Jones would follow this idea with similar personality-less depictions in the ' ' Rabbit of Seville ' ' ( 1950 ) and ' ' Baton Bunny ' ' ( 1959 ) . This contrasts with orchestra-driven animated shorts by other creators . By assuming the position of the conductor , Bugs places himself at the top of the musical hierarchy . He forces Giovanni into an improvised vocalization which spans his entire range and an exercise of all his technical skills . He then forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings the Hollywood Bowl crashing down on the singer . Bugs assumes the stereotypical attributes of famous conductors , displaying majesty , arrogance , and tyrannical behavior . He also follows the dress code of the concert hall by wearing white tie and tails , formal wear which is still associated with performers . # Censorship # *On ABC , the entire bobby soxer sequence ( with Bugs dressed as a bobby soxer giving Giovanni Jones a dynamite stick as a pen while getting his autograph ) is cut . *On CBS , in addition to the ABC cut , all three times Bugs gets beaten up by Giovanni for interrupting his singing ( smashing Bugs ' banjo over his head after crushing it to pieces ; slamming the harp shut on Bugs ' neck ; pulling Bugs through his tuba , then tying Bugs ' ears to a tree branch , pulling his feet and snapping him back and forth so his head repeatedly strikes the branch ) are cut , giving no reason for Bugs to ruin Giovanni 's concert . # Availability # * ' ' Long-Haired Hare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remastered , on the ' Looney Tunes Golden Collection : Volume 1 ' ' DVD set , Disc 1 .
