In July 62 Zora Arkus-Duntov selected Dave MacDonald and Dick Thompson to test-drive the new 1963 Corvette Sting Ray at the General Motors Proving Grounds in Milford Michigan . GM used footage of the drivers testing the cars to create a promotional film entitled Biography of a Sports Car . The film was distributed around the globe as part of GM 's marketing campaign promoting the new sports car . The following month Duntov and other Chevrolet executives presented MacDonald with the first ever 1963 Z06 Sting Ray . MacDonald debuted the Sting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated matchup with Carroll Shelbys new Ford Cobra Roadster . MacDonald and Cobra driver Billy Krause exchanged the lead for the first hour before both cars dropped out with mechanical troubles . At the start of the 1963 season Carroll Shelby hired MacDonald away from Chevrolet to drive his Cobra Roadster . In his first outing for Shelby American , MacDonald drove Cobra CSX2026 to back-to-back victories at Riverside International Raceway on February 2-3 , 1963 . These were Cobras first wins . Teammate Ken Miles finished 2nd both days in Cobra CSX2002 . On February 17 , 1963 MacDonald finished 4th in Cobra CSX2026 at the Daytona Continental FIA to give the Cobra its first top 5 finish in international competition .

MacDonald again won both days in Cobra CSX2026 for the 289 's first wins . In the fall of 1963 , MacDonald rose to national prominence after driving Shelby King Cobra CM/1/63 to back-to-back Grand Prix wins in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles Times Grand Prix and the Monterey Pacific Grand Prix . These were the first wins for the Shelby King Cobra . In his next three races he finished 2nd at the Hawaiian Grand Prix in Cobra Roadster CSX2136 , 2nd at NASCARs Golden State 400 in the ' ' Wood Brothers ' ' #21 Ford and 2nd in NASCARs Augusta 510 behind Holman/Moody teammate and race winner Fireball Roberts .

The award was first issued in 1936 and given to the athlete who dominated his or her sport through outstanding performance . MacDonald was only the ninth auto racer to receive this honor and the first during the US football season . 1964 would be MacDonalds final year in racing and while remaining committed to a full Cobra schedule with Shelby American he signed to run 21 races on the NASCAR circuit for Ford factory member Bill Stroppe . MacDonald also signed a 2-yr contract with Mickey Thompson to run the 64 &amp; 65 Indianapolis 500 's . On February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daytona 500 , finishing 10th in a Bill Stroppe Mercury .

His average speed of 97.653 MPH was 11 MPH faster than the previous track record set by Fireball Roberts in the Augusta 510 . After this victory Hall of Fame motor sports journalist Chris Economaki wrote Dave MacDonald just stamped himself as one of today 's road racing greats . March 21 , 1964 , MacDonald and Bob Holbert drove Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe CSX2287 to a GT Class win ( 4th OA ) in the 12 Hours of Sebring international endurance race .

May 10 , 1964 MacDonald won the United States Road Racing Championships at Kent WA in King Cobra CM/3/63 . The victory put him in a tie atop the United States Drivers Championship standings with Jim Hall . This would be MacDonald 's last race before his death three weeks later in the Indy 500. # Indy 500 # Mickey Thompson hired MacDonald to drive one of his radical low profile rear-engine race cars in the 1964 Indy 500 . Thompson 's Ford-powered racers were specifically designed to run on tiny 12 tires and after debuting in the 1963 Indy 500 the cars became known as Roller Skates . They were far ahead of their time , but badly designed and difficult to drive . Graham Hill tested the car before the ' 63 Indy race and refused to drive it because of its poor handling , a condition made worse for 1964 when Thompson was forced to completely redesign the cars to accommodate the new USAC-mandated 15in mm minimum tire height . One of the changes Thompson made to improve stability was to fit his cars with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-wheeled speedway . Thompson hired MacDonald , a rookie at Indy , and veteran racer Masten Gregory to drive two of his three cars in 64 but several of the top drivers declined offers to drive the revolutionary but undeveloped cars . Graham Hill tested Thompson 's new 64 design and like the previous year he declined . Thompson selected Duane Carter to join Gregory and MacDonald and in the first week of May all three cars crashed or spun in practice . Gregory quit the team citing the poor handling of his car and Thompson found it difficult to find a replacement as other available drivers took the advice of Gregory and stayed away . 15-time Indy 500 competitor Eddie Johnson did accept Thompsons offer and joined the team in mid-May . It was reported that while out practicing with MacDonald on Carb Day , 1963 World Champion Jim Clark noticed strange movement from MacDonald 's car , followed him into the pits and urged him to Get out of that car , mate - just walk away . According to journalist Chris Economaki , MacDonald never practiced with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high speeds . Despite handling woes MacDonald qualified the Thompson #83 car at an average speed of 151.464 mph , placing him in the middle of row 5 and in 14th position . Johnson qualified Gregory 's reconstructed #84 car and placed it on the outside of row 8 and in 24th position . On the final day of qualifying Thompson hired Chuck Arnold ( 15th in the 1959 Indy 500 ) to try and qualify the #82 car but after spinning twice in morning practice Arnold walked away . With only a few hours left in qualifying Thompson approached Gregory and asked if he 'd come back to the team and run the #82 car . Gregory , still without a ride for the 500 , agreed to attempt to qualify the #82 car for Thompson , but said he would not run it in the race . Gregory made a late day run but was unable to get up to speed and neither he nor the #82 car ran the 500. # Death # MacDonald started in the 14th position in the 1964 Indy 500 and after dropping two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving toward the leaders . As he passed Johnny Rutherford and Eddie Sachs , Rutherford noticed that MacDonald 's car was very loose . Rutherford later said that , watching the behavior of MacDonald 's car , he thought , Whoa , he 's either gon na win this thing or crash . MacDonald was in the 10th position as he came out of turn 4 and on to the front straight to complete lap 2 . As MacDonald moved left to pass Walt Hansgen the front end of his car lifted and he lost control . His car slide across the track and hit the inside retaining wall igniting the 45 gallon fuel load and causing a massive fire . His car then slid back up the track toward the outside wall and six more cars became involved . Eddie Sachs , blinded by flames and smoke , broadsided MacDonald 's car resulting in another fireball . For the first time in its history the Indianapolis 500 was stopped because of an accident . According to reports Sachs died instantly due to blunt-force injuries while MacDonald was transported to Methodist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie Johnson retired the other Thompson car after only 6 laps . The fiery crash led to safety changes at Indianapolis Motor Speedway including a USAC requirement that cars carry less fuel , a change that led every team to switch from gasoline to methanol prior to the next year 's Indy 500 . Carroll Shelby , Mickey Thompson , Bill Stroppe and Don Steves were among the pallbearers serving at MacDonald 's funeral . # Noteworthy # * MacDonald drove each of the legendary Shelby Cobras Cobra Roadster , King Cobra , King Cobra-Lang Cooper and Cobra Daytona Coupe to their first-ever victories . * In 1964 MacDonald was set to make his motion picture debut in the Universal Pictures film The Lively Set .
