It is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco . Originally called Riordan High School , the school was named after Archbishop Patrick William Riordan , the second Archbishop of San Francisco , and opened in the fall of 1949 . In 1990 , Archbishop was officially added to the school 's name . The school is best known for its historically successful basketball , wrestling , track and field , football , marching band , concert band , and theatre programs . # Mission statement # Archbishop Riordan High School , an Archdiocesan Catholic High School in the Marianist Tradition , develops the character of young men and instills Christian values in an environment of academic excellence that reflects the cultural diversity of the San Francisco Bay Area . # The Marianists # The Marianist Organization has remained a guiding force throughout Riordan 's existence and follows several specific Characteristics of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for formation in faith . * Provide an integral , quality education . * Educate in family spirit . * Educate for service , justice &amp; peace . * Educate for adaptation &amp; change . # Academics # All full-time faculty , librarians , and counselors are represented by a labor union and have a collective bargaining agreement with the Archdiocese of San Francisco .

One major criticism of the school 's 4x4 schedule is in respect to Advanced Placement courses . Such AP courses taught in the Fall semester would end in December , but students take the actual AP Exam in May . Thus , the student is expected to retain the learned material for five months . In addition , because the AP exam is administered in early May , courses taught in the Spring semester are often cut short by three weeks . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very valuable in the 4x4 block schedule and often forces the instructor to cram the material in the weeks approaching the AP exam . Most AP teachers compensate for this with review sessions held outside of class . Archbishop Riordan High School offers a variety of Honors and Advanced Placement courses . Advanced Placement offerings include : AP Calculus AB/BC AP Chemistry AP Environmental Science AP Physics AP English Language AP English Literature AP Spanish Language AP Statistics AP European History AP World History AP United States History AP United States Government AP Psychology AP Economics ( Micro and Macro ) The AP Calculus class , taught by Mr. Paul Arrigotti from the 1970s through 2009 , is nationally recognized for its high passing rates and scholastic achievement .

Many students were expected to buy an iPad and buy the required apps for the school year . The school was finally able to adapt to this new technology during the second semester , where it was used to its full potential . Many teachers are able to receive work from students via email , whereas reading assignments and homework assignments can be seen by both students and teacher through iTunes U. All students are required to use this helpful technology . Every area of the school ( except the football field ) has internet for the student to use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . Also , there is a strict disciplinary code for the students to follow , such as confiscation of the iPad if the student is caught playing games in class . # Student body # The 100% male student population ranges from 640 to 660 at Archbishop Riordan High School .

Participating in the newly created Catholic League for high schools around San Francisco , the Crusaders experienced immediate success in a multitude of areas . The student body enthusiastically supported the program , as Riordan fielded new sports every few years . Notable events of the decade include the first football game at Riordan ( September 18 , 1951 ) , the first homecoming night rally ( November 10 , 1955 ) , the Riordan versus St. Ignatius College Preparatory football game at Seals Stadium ( November 3 , 1956 ) , the Faculty versus Seniors basketball game ( April 4 , 1957 ) , and the Block Society 's sponsoring of Fight Night , which featured eight boxing matches as well as wrestling and judo ( March 28 , 1958 ) .

To many he is a symbol of the origins and development of Riordan , and to thousands of alumni was the epitome of sportsmanship and gentlemanly behavior .

Joining the new West Catholic Athletic League in 1967 , the Crusaders became successful in a number of athletic endeavors . The victory bell was introduced , which still resides in the junior hallway of the school . It was put to good use , as basketball won varsity championships in ' 60 , ' 68 , and ' 69 ; cross country won championships in ' 65 , ' 66 , ' 68 , and ' 69 ) ; football in ' 66 ; and Track in ' 67 and ' 68 .

This coincided with the 1966 football team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc Erskine , the Crusaders battled the Bellarmine Bells under the lights of Kezar Stadium to come out on top , 13-10 . In their exuberance after the game , students tore down the goalposts at Kezar , fashioning trophies of the wood . These trophies , signed by the team , reside in the Crusader Forum today , memorializing their legendary upset for the first WCAL championship . # 1970s # The ' 70s saw the most varsity championships ( 13 in all ) and the greatest varsity record ( 6 sports ) . They included : One each in track and cross country , 2 in football and baseball , 3 in basketball , and 4 in soccer . Soccer soared at Riordan during this decade . The varsity won four consecutive WCAL titles and the Central Coast Section championship in 1976 .

Riordan saw the birth of Camp Crusader , a summer camp for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp in 1974 for boys in 4th through 8th grades . Consisting of two three week sessions , hundreds of youngsters swarmed to Riordan .

Participants received a camp polo shirt and a trip to see the Giants at Candlestick Park . # 1980s # By 1980 , Riordan had established itself as a Bay Area powerhouse in a variety of sports , but had yet to create an athletic niche , an area that would unquestionably be the territory of the Crusaders . Under the direction of Coach Ron Isola , Riordan would become a basketball juggernaut , winning six straight championships from 1985 to 1990 . A legend in his own time , Isola ushered in an era of Riordan dominance in basketball , going to sectional and state championships several times . Another feature of the ' 80s would be the wrestling program . Started in 1979 under Coach Steve Swanson , the sport caught fire among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Although the Crusaders never won a championship , Swanson guided ten individual league champion wrestlers and six CCS placers . Among these was Adam Cohen , two-time CCS champion and an eventual NCAA finalist at Arizona State University . Wrestlers competed abroad as well , carrying the Crusader banner to Las Vegas , Honolulu , and Russia . # 2010s # In recent years the wrestling program has stood out , with current principal and former head coach Vittorio Anastasio ( class of 83 ) leading the way . From 2011 to 2013 the team was able to earn top 10 finishes at the CCS Masters tournament . The most notable standout was Zac Contreras , now at SF State , who eventually became Riordan 's most decorated athlete for the decade .
