@@1268514 Mangyan is the generic name for the eight indigenous groups found on the island of Mindoro , southwest of island of Luzon , the Philippines , each with its own tribal name , language , and customs . The total population may be around 100,000 , but official statistics are difficult to determine under the conditions of remote areas , reclusive tribal groups and some having little if any outside world contact . The ethnic groups of the island , from north to south , are : Iraya , Alangan , Tadyawan , Tawbuid ( called Batangan by lowlanders on the west of the island ) , Buhid , Hanunoo . An additional group on the south coast is labelled Ratagnon . They appear to be intermarried with lowlanders . The group known on the east of Mindoro as Bangon may be a subgroup of Tawbuid , as they speak the ' western ' dialect of that language . They also have an alphabet which is called the Ambahan . Mangyan are mainly subsistence agriculturalists , planting a variety of sweet potato , upland ( dry cultivation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wild pig . Many who live in close contact with lowland Filipinos sell cash crops such as bananas and ginger . Their languages are mutually unintelligible , though they share some vocabulary and use Hanun'o script to write : Tawbuid and Buhid are closely related , and are unusual among Philippine languages in having an phoneme ; Tawbuid is divided into eastern and western dialects ; Western Tawbuid may be the only Philippine language to have no glottal phonemes , having neither or . Their traditional religious world view is : primarily animistic ; around 10% have embraced Christianity , both Roman Catholicism and Evangelical Protestantism ( The New Testaments has been published in six of the Mangyan languages ) . # In popular culture # *Two Mangyan children is the focus of an indie film.The story began when a kid tried to find her brother , presumably descended to the town.Followed by her friend , they traveled the rapids , mountains , traveling along with a NPA rebel , getting captured by the soldiers , arriving in the town and among others , until she found out what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
