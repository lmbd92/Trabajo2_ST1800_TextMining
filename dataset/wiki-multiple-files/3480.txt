@@32043514 John Finlayson or Finleyson ( 1770-1854 ) , was a disciple of Richard Brothers . Finlayson was born in Scotland in 1770 . His descendants make him the second son of Colonel John Hamilton M'Finlay , who married , about 1765 , Lady Elizabeth Mary Alexander , eldest sister of the last Earl of Stirling . He was originally a writer at Cupar , Fife , and removed thence to Edinburgh . His relations with Brothers , which began in 1797 , are detailed in the article on that enthusiast . He printed at Edinburgh a couple of pamphlets before repairing to London . In London he was ' in considerable practice as a house agent . ' Brothers led him to change the spelling of his name , by telling him his ancestors had some ' fine leys ' of land granted them for deeds of valour . Brothers , who died ( 1824 ) in Finlayson 's house at Marylebone , made it his dying charge to his friend that he should write against a rival genius , Bartholomew Prescot of Liverpool . This Finlayson did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' very correctly , as a ' misapprehended mistaken elaborate performance , or book . ' # Publications # He printed a variety of pamphlets , reiterating Brothers 's views , and developing his own peculiar notions of astronomy , for which he claimed a divine origin . The heavenly bodies were created , he thinks , partly ' to amuse us in observing them . ' The earth he decides to be a perfect sphere , ' not shaped like a garden turnip , as the Newtonians make it ; ' the sun is a created body ' very different from anything we can make here below ; ' the stars are ' oval-shaped immense masses of frozen water , with their largest ends foremost . ' Finlayson printed : # ' An Admonition to the People of all Countries in support of Richard Brothers , ' 8vo ( dated Edinburgh , 7 Sept. 1797 ) . # The same , ' Book Second , ' containing ' The Restoration of the Hebrews to their own Land , ' 8vo ( dated Edinburgh , 27 Jan. 1798 ) . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . xii . 7 , 11,12 ; dated London , 2 March 1798 ) . # ' An Essay on the First Resurrection , and on the Commencement of the Blessed Thousand Years , ' 8vo ( dated London , 14 April 1798 ) . # ' The Universe as it is . Discovery of the Ten Tribes of Israel and their Restoration to their own Land , ' 1832 , 8 vo. # ' God 's Creation of the Universe , ' 1848 , 8vo ( contains some of his letters to the authorities respecting his claims on Brothers 's estate ; Mason and Prescot were angry at this publication , but Finlayson had ' a dream and vision ' of Brothers , approving all he had done ) . # ' The Seven Seals of the Revelations . ' # ' The Last Trumpet , ' &amp;c. , 1849 , 8vo ( incorporates No. 7 ; there are several supplements , the latest dated 21 Feb. 1850 ) .
