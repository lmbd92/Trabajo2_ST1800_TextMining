@@21514 Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology . Nanomedicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials , to nanoelectronic biosensors , and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology . Current problems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact of nanoscale materials ( materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers , i.e. billionths of a meter ) . Nanomedicine research is receiving funding from the US National Institutes of Health . Of note is the funding in 2005 of a five-year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers . In April 2006 , the journal Nature Materials estimated that 130 nanotech-based drugs and delivery systems were being developed worldwide . # Overview # The biological and medical research communities have exploited the unique properties of nanomaterials for various applications ( e.g. , contrast agents for cell imaging and therapeutics for treating cancer ) . Terms such as ' ' biomedical nanotechnology ' ' , ' ' nanobiotechnology ' ' , and ' ' nanomedicine ' ' are used to describe this hybrid field . Functionalities can be added to nanomaterials by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nanomaterials is similar to that of most biological molecules and structures ; therefore , nanomaterials can be useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications . Thus far , the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices , contrast agents , analytical tools , physical therapy applications , and drug delivery vehicles . Nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful devices in the near future . The National Nanotechnology Initiative expects new commercial applications in the pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems , new therapies , and in vivo imaging . Neuro-electronic interfaces and other nanoelectronics-based sensors are another active goal of research . Further down the line , the speculative field of molecular nanotechnology believes that cell repair machines could revolutionize medicine and the medical field . Nanomedicine is a large industry , with nanomedicine sales reaching $6.8 billion in 2004 , and with over 200 companies and 38 products worldwide , a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology R&amp;D is being invested every year . As the nanomedicine industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant impact on the economy . # Medical use of nanomaterials # Two forms of nanomedicine that have already been tested in mice and are awaiting human trials that will be using gold nanoshells to help diagnose and treat cancer , and using liposomes as vaccine adjuvants and as vehicles for drug transport . Similarly , drug detoxification is also another application for nanomedicine which has shown promising results in rats . A benefit of using nanoscale for medical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside the body , plus biochemical reaction times are much shorter . These devices are faster and more sensitive than typical drug delivery . Advances in Lipid nanotechnology was also instrumental in engineering medical nanodevices and novel drug delivery systems as well as in developing sensing applications . # Drug delivery # Nanotechnology has provided the possibility of delivering drugs to specific cells using nanoparticles . The overall drug consumption and side-effects may be lowered significantly by depositing the active agent in the morbid region only and in no higher dose than needed . This highly selective approach would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in dendrimers and nanoporous materials . Another example is to use block co-polymers , which form micelles for drug encapsulation . They could hold small drug molecules transporting them to the desired location . Another vision is based on small electromechanical systems ; nanoelectromechanical systems are being investigated for the active release of drugs . Some potentially important applications include cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells . Targeted drug delivery is intended to reduce the side effects of drugs with concomitant decreases in consumption and treatment expenses . The increased efficiency of delivery results in overall societal benefit by reducing the amount of drug needed in an equipotent preparation of said therapy , and thus reduced cost to the consumer . Nanomedical approaches to drug delivery center on developing nanoscale particles or molecules to improve drug bioavailability . Bioavailability refers to the presence of drug molecules where they are needed in the body and where they will do the most good . Drug delivery focuses on maximizing bioavailability both at specific places in the body and over a period of time . This can potentially be achieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeting the molecules and delivering drugs with cell precision . More than $65 billion are wasted each year due to poor bioavailability . ' ' In vivo ' ' imaging is another area where tools and devices are being developed . Using nanoparticle contrast agents , images such as ultrasound and MRI have a favorable distribution and improved contrast . The new methods of nanoengineered materials that are being developed might be effective in treating illnesses and diseases such as cancer . What nanoscientists will be able to achieve in the future is beyond current imagination . This might be accomplished by self assembled biocompatible nanodevices that will detect , evaluate , treat and report to the clinical doctor automatically . Drug delivery systems , lipid- or polymer-based nanoparticles , can be designed to improve the pharmacological and therapeutic properties of drugs . The strength of drug delivery systems is their ability to alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the drug . However , the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients . When designed to avoid the body 's defence mechanisms , nanoparticles have beneficial properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger particles would have been cleared from the body , cells take up these nanoparticles because of their size . Complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed , including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm . Efficiency is important because many diseases depend upon processes within the cell and can only be impeded by drugs that make their way into the cell . Triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently . Drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal . For example , a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist , improving the solubility . Also , a drug may cause tissue damage , but with drug delivery , regulated drug release can eliminate the problem . If a drug is cleared too quickly from the body , this could force a patient to use high doses , but with drug delivery systems clearance can be reduced by altering the pharmacokinetics of the drug . Poor biodistribution is a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particulates from drug delivery systems lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non-target tissue . Potential nanodrugs will work by very specific and well-understood mechanisms ; one of the major impacts of nanotechnology and nanoscience will be in leading development of completely new drugs with more useful behavior and less side effects . Polymeric nano-particles are a competing technology to lipidic ( based mainly on Phospholipids ) nano-particles . There is an additional risk of toxicity associated with polymers not widely studied or understood . This toxicity could include ( but not limited to ) hepatotoxicity , nephrotoxicity etc. and can have long term impacts not easily evaluated in short term in-vivo clinical trials either in animals or humans . Since the degradation of polymers to either their monomers or other degradation products in the body can not be accurately predicted ( unclear metabolic pathway ) , this is a real risk , specially in medicines intended for long term patient use . Even if the toxicity is ignored , there is additional hepatic load of metabolism , again an area of concern for long term medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost and predictable characterisation , so the formulation chemists prefer this . However , in the patient 's body this very stability ( slow degradation ) is a negative factor . Phospholipids on the other hand are membrane lipids ( already present in the body and surrounding each cell ) , have a GRAS ( Generally Recognised As Safe ) status from FDA and are derived from natural sources without any complex chemistry involved . They are not metabolised but rather absorbed by the body and the degradation products are themselves nutrients ( fats or micronutrients ) . It is greatly observed that nanoparticles are promising tools for the advancement of drug delivery , medical imaging , and as diagnostic sensors . However , the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex host 's reactions to nano- and microsized materials <sup> 14 </sup> and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body . Nevertheless , a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems . For example , current research in the excretory systems of mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs based on their size and charge . These composites are encapsulated by a dendrimer and assigned a specific charge and size . Positively-charged gold nanoparticles were found to enter the kidneys while negatively-charged gold nanoparticles remained in the liver and spleen . It is suggested that the positive surface charge of the nanoparticle decreases the rate of opsonization of nanoparticles in the liver , thus affecting the excretory pathway . Even at a relatively small size of 5 nm , though , these particles can become compartmentalized in the peripheral tissues , and will therefore accumulate in the body over time . While advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles , the dangers of nanotoxicity become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses . Nanoparticles are also used to circumvent multidrug resistance ( MDR ) mechanisms . Mechanisms of MDR include decreased uptake of drugs , reduced intracellular drug concentration by activation of the efflux transporters , modifications in cellular pathways by altering cell cycle checkpoints , increased metabolism of drugs , induced emergency response genes to impair apoptotic pathways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research studies# # *Abraxane , approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to treat breast cancer , non-small- cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and pancreatic cancer , is the nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel. *Doxil was originally approved by the FDA for the use on HIV-related Kaposi 's sarcoma . It is now being used to also treat ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma . The drug is encased in liposomes , which helps to extend the life of the drug that is being distributed . Liposomes are self-assembling , spherical , closed colloidal structures that are composed of lipid bilayers that surround an aqueous space . The liposomes also help to increase the functionality and it helps to decrease the damage that the drug does to the heart muscles specifically . *In a mice study , scientists from Rice University and University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reported enhanced effectiveness and reduced toxicity of an existing treatment for head and neck cancer when using the nanoparticles to deliver the drug . The hydrophilic carbonic clusters functionalized with polyethylene glycol or PEG-HCC are mixed with the chemotherapeutic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptor ( EGFR ) targeted Cetuximab and injected intravenously . They found the tumors were killed more effectively with radiation and the healthy tissue suffered less toxicity than without the nanotechnology drug delivery . The standard treatment contains Cremophor EL which allows the hydrophobic paclitaxel to be delivered intravenously . Replacing the toxic Cremophor with carbon nanoparticles eliminated its side effect and improved drug targeting which in turn required a lower dose of the toxic paclitaxel. *Researchers at Case Western Reserve University reported using nanoparticle chain to deliver doxorubicin to breast cancer cells in a mice study . Three magnetic , iron-oxide nanospheres were chemically linked to one doxorubicin-loaded liposome and formed a 100 nm long nanoparticle chain . After the nanochains penetrated the tumor , radiofrequency field was generated that caused the magnetic nanoparticles to vibrate and rupture the liposome , dispersing the drug in its free form throughout the tumor . The result showed that the nano treatment was more effective in halting tumor growth than the standard treatment with doxorubicin . It is also less harmful to healthy cells since only 5% to 10% of the standard dose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PEG ) carrying payload of antibiotics at its core could swift charge thus allowing them to target bacterial infection more precisely inside the body , a group of MIT researchers reported . The nanoparticles , containing a sub-layer of pH sensitive chains of the amino acid histidine , carry a slightly negative charge when circulating in the blood stream , can evade detection and clearing by the immune system . When they encounter an infection site the particles gain a positive charge provoked by the slightly acidic environment at the infection sites , allowing them to bind to the negatively charged bacterial cell walls and release antibiotics at locally high concentration . This nano delivery system can potentially destroy bacteria even if it has developed resistance to antibiotics because of the targeted high dose and prolonged release of the drug . Although a lot of work is still needed , the researchers believe that it points to a new direction of using nanotechnology to treat infectious disease . *Using the biomimetic strategy , researchers in the Harvard University Wyss Institute demonstrated in a mouse model that the drug coated nanoparticles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions in the blood vessels just like the platelets do . Aggregates of biodegradable nanoparticles coated with tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , each about the size of a platelet , were injected intravenously . In the region of vessel narrowing , shear stresses dissociate the aggregates and release the tPA-coated nanoparticles which bind and degrade the blood clots . By prcised targeting and concentrating drug at the location of obstruction , the dose used is less than 1/50th of the normal dose . The nanotherapeutics will greatly reduce the severe side effect of bleeding , commonly found in standard treatment of thrombosis . *An early phase clinical trial using the platform of Minicell nanoparticle for drug delivery have been tested on patients with advanced and untreatable cancer . Built from the membranes of mutant bacteria , the minicells were loaded with paclitaxel and coated with cetuximab , antibodies that bind the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) which is often overexpressed in a number of cancers , as a ' homing ' device to the tumor cells . The tumor cells recognize the bacteria from which the minicells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engulf it . Once inside , the payload of anti-cancer drug kills the tumor cells . Measured at 400 nanometers , the minicell is bigger than synthetic particles developed for drug delivery . The researchers indicated that this larger size gives the minicells a better profile in side-effects because the minicells will preferentially leak out of the porous blood vessels around the tumor cells and do not reach the liver , digestive system and skin . This Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that this treatment is well tolerated by the patients . As a platform technology , the minicell drug delivery system can be used to treat a number of different cancers with different anti-cancer drugs with the benefit of lower dose and less side-effects . *Researchers at The Methodist Hospital Research Institute in Houston have created ' LeukoLike Vectors ' or LLVs . LLVs are the drug-carrying silicon nanoparticles coated with the lipoprotein removed from the membranes of the white blood cells , leukocytes . The ' cloaked ' nanoparticles were found to behave like leukocytes , are able to evade the body 's immune system and survive much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scientists expressed that LLVs are able to overcome a major hurdle in nanomedicine delivery by avoiding clearance in blood stream , crossing the biological barriers and localizing at target tissues due to its leukocyte like characters . Synthetic membranes are expected to develop in the future to replace harvest from the white blood cells due to the limited source of leukocyte. *Inhalable nanocarriers were developed using a nanostructured lipid nanocarrier-based system ( NLCS ) . The lipid nanoparticles contain the drug payload ( doxorubicin or paclitaxel ) ; two types of small interfering RNA ( siRNA , targeted the BCL-2 mRNA to suppress nonpump cellular resistance , and MRP1 mRNA to suppress pump drug resistance ) ; and the targeting molecules , an analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) which homes in the overexpressed receptors of the cancer cells . The disease model tested was a mouse model of human lung cancer . Results showed enhanced antitumor activity and significant reduction of exposure of healthy organs when compared to the conventional intravenous treatment . *Self-powered nanoparticles with a payload of osteoporosis drug are reported to be pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion gradients generated by leaked minerals ( ions ) from the bone , and deliver highly targeted drugs for healing . Using a model system of human tibia and femur , researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Boston University used nanoparticles of polylactic-coglycolic acid ( widely used in medical devices ) carrying sodium alendronate ( an osteoporosis drug ) for the ' ' in vitro ' ' experiments and found the ' nanotrucks ' successfully carry the drug to the fresh crack of the human bone . *Nanodiamond is diamond particle with a diameter of 2 to 8 nm and surface functional groups to bind various kinds of molecule . Clusters of the nanodiamonds in the range of 50-100 nm in diameter can be manufactured to trap drug inside and slowly release the payload . Experiments by researchers in Northwestern University on mouse models with chemotherapy-resistant liver and breast cancers show that the nanodiamonds with a normally lethal dose of doxorubicin significantly reduce the size of the tumors without toxic side effects expected from the drug if administered alone . The nanodiamond drug complex is found to have a much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , once inside the tumor , the nanoparticles are retained much longer . Additional studies using nanodiamonds include treating the triple-negative breast cancer with epirubicin and glioblastoma with doxorubicin . Increase in survival rate with reduced side effects were observed in both the mouse models . UCLA reported that contact lens embedded with nanodiamonds at the size of 5 nm in diameter and loaded with the glaucoma drug timolol maleate allow controlled and sustained release of the medicine . The nanodiamonds were combined with the polymer chitosan which is cleaved when the lens make contact with the lysozyme in tears . The drug releases slowly in the eyes when the nanodiamond structure breaks down . *In regenerative medicine research , silica based nanoparticles are used to deliver molecules to transplanted cells derived from stem cells . Using a mouse model , scientists delivered two synthetic versions of neurotrophic growth factors locally using mesoporous nanoparticles to motor neurons derived from transplanted embryonic stem cells and reported improved long term survival and functional differentiation of the transplant ' ' in vivo ' ' . *Nanoparticle with a liposomal core and a gel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shrink breast cancer tumor in a mouse model . Researchers in the North Carolina State University designed this nanoparticle , called Gelipo , to deliver both drugs simultaneously and maximize the efficiency of both . The cross-linked hyaluronic acid ( HA ) shell holds and protects the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) while the core carries liposomes filled with doxorubicin embedded with peptide . HA preferentially concentrates in hyaluronidase ( HAase ) rich tumor environment and interacts with receptors on the cancer cell membranes . When the HAase degrades the gel shell of Gelipo , the TRAIL protein is released onto the cell membrane and triggers apoptosis ( cell death ) . The core liposomes are internalized by the tumor cells into endosomes , the cellular transport system . The peptide breaks down the endosome and releases doxorubicin intracellularly , maximizes the efficacy while minimizes the toxic side effects . # Protein and peptide delivery # Protein and peptides exert multiple biological actions in the human body and they have been identified as showing great promise for treatment of various diseases and disorders . These macromolecules are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using nanomaterials like nanoparticles and Dendrimers is an emerging field called nanobiopharmaceutics , and these products are called nanobiopharmaceuticals. # #Applications and reported research studies# # *Nanoparticles delivering the myelin antigens were found to induce immune tolerance in a mouse model with relapsing multiple sclerosis . Biodegradable polystyrene microparticles coated with the myelin sheath peptides reset the mouse 's immune system and prevent the disease from recurring or reduce the symptoms by halting the attack of the immune system to the protective myelin sheath coating the nerve fibers of the central nervous system . Team of researchers in Northwestern University indicated that this treatment method can potentially be used in other autoimmune diseases . *Researchers at UCLA developed a nanoparticle system with water-soluble shell encapsulated a protein derived from bird anemia virus , apoptin . Apoptin selectively sends self-destruct signal to tumor cells and trigger the programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) as it builds up in the nucleus , while leaving healthy cells unharmed . In the mouse model of human breast cancer , the treatment was found to significantly reduce the tumors growth . This new form of treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming healthy cells , a common pitfall of chemotherapy , and no probability of genetic mutation that usually accompanies gene therapy . *A nano-network of nanoparticles with a solid core of insulin , modified dextran and glucose oxidase was demonstrated to be able to regulate and maintain normal blood sugar level in a mouse model with Type 1 diabetes for up to 10 days . The nanoparticle is coated with either the positively charged chitosan ( from shrimp shells ) or negatively charged alginate ( from seaweed ) . The opposite charges hold the nanoparticles together as a nano-network even after they are injected subcutaneously . The porous particles allow blood to make contact with the nanoparticle cores . When there is high blood sugar level , glucose oxidase is activated and breaks down the dextran into gluconic acid . The disintegration of the cores releases the insulin which controls the blood sugar level to the normal range . # Cancer # The small size of nanoparticles endows them with properties that can be very useful in oncology , particularly in imaging . Quantum dots ( nanoparticles with quantum confinement properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conjunction with MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , can produce exceptional images of tumor sites . These nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light source for excitation . This means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image and at a lower cost than today 's organic dyes used as contrast media . The downside , however , is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements . Another nanoproperty , high surface area to volume ratio , allows many functional groups to be attached to a nanoparticle , which can seek out and bind to certain tumor cells . Additionally , the small size of nanoparticles ( 10 to 100 nanometers ) , allows them to preferentially accumulate at tumor sites ( because tumors lack an effective lymphatic drainage system ) . Research into multifunctional nanoparticles that would detect , image , and then proceed to treat a tumor is under way . A promising new cancer treatment that may one day replace radiation and chemotherapy is edging closer to human trials . Kanzius RF therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the body with radio waves that heat only the nanoparticles and the adjacent ( cancerous ) cells . Sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires , able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells , could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patient 's blood . The basic point to use drug delivery is based upon three facts : a ) efficient encapsulation of the drugs , b ) successful delivery of said drugs to the targeted region of the body , and c ) successful release of that drug there . Researchers at Rice University under Prof. Jennifer West , have demonstrated the use of 120 nm diameter nanoshells coated with gold to kill cancer tumors in mice . The nanoshells can be targeted to bond to cancerous cells by conjugating antibodies or peptides to the nanoshell surface . By irradiating the area of the tumor with an infrared laser , which passes through flesh without heating it , the gold is heated sufficiently to cause death to the cancer cells . Limitations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lack of solubility . Nanoparticles have the potential to overcome these problems . Nanoparticles of cadmium selenide ( quantum dots ) glow when exposed to ultraviolet light . When injected , they seep into cancer tumors . The surgeon can see the glowing tumor , and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal . In photodynamic therapy , a particle is placed within the body and is illuminated with light from the outside . The light gets absorbed by the particle and if the particle is metal , energy from the light will heat the particle and surrounding tissue . Light may also be used to produce high energy oxygen molecules which will chemically react with and destroy most organic molecules that are next to them ( like tumors ) . This therapy is appealing for many reasons . It does not leave a toxic trail of reactive molecules throughout the body ( chemotherapy ) because it is directed where only the light is shined and the particles exist . Photodynamic therapy has potential for a noninvasive procedure for dealing with diseases , growth and tumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous therapeutic functions into a single platform , by targeting specific tumor cells , tissues and organs . Actually , Conde et al . reported the evaluation of the inflammatory response and therapeutic siRNA silencing via RGD-nanoparticles in a lung cancer mouse model . This study reported the use of siRNA/RGD gold nanoparticles capable of targeting tumor cells in two lung cancer xenograft mouse models , resulting in successful and significant ' ' c-Myc ' ' oncogene downregulation followed by tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival of the animals . This delivery system can achieve translocation of siRNA duplexes directly into the tumour cell cytoplasm and accomplish successful silencing of an oncogene expression . Actually , RGD/siRNA-AuNPs can target preferentially and be taken up by tumor cells via integrin v3-receptor-mediated endocytosis with no cytotoxicity , showing that can accumulate in tumor tissues overexpressing v3 integrins and selectively delivered ' ' c-Myc ' ' siRNA to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis. # Surgery # At Rice University , a flesh welder is used to fuse two pieces of chicken meat into a single piece . The two pieces of chicken are placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dribbled along the seam . An infrared laser is traced along the seam , causing the two sides to weld together . This could solve the difficulties and blood leaks caused when the surgeon tries to restitch the arteries that have been cut during a kidney or heart transplant . The flesh welder could weld the artery perfectly . # Visualization # Tracking movement can help determine how well drugs are being distributed or how substances are metabolized . It is difficult to track a small group of cells throughout the body , so scientists used to dye the cells . These dyes needed to be excited by light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up . While different color dyes absorb different frequencies of light , there was a need for as many light sources as cells . A way around this problem is with luminescent tags . These tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrate cell membranes . The dots can be random in size , can be made of bio-inert material , and they demonstrate the nanoscale property that color is size-dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frequency of light used to make a group of quantum dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make another group incandesce . Then both groups can be lit with a single light source . They have also found a way to insert nanoparticles into the affected parts of the body so that those parts of the body will glow showing the tumor growth or shrinkage or also organ trouble . # Tissue engineering # Nanotechnology may be able to help reproduce or repair damaged tissue . Tissue engineering makes use of artificially stimulated cell proliferation by using suitable nanomaterial-based scaffolds and growth factors . For example , bones could be regrown on carbon nanotube scaffolds . Tissue engineering might replace today 's conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants . Advanced forms of tissue engineering may lead to life extension . Artificial bone composites are also being manufactured from nanocrystalline calcium phosphates. # Antimicrobial effects # Nanoparticles can be used in combination therapy for decreasing antibiotic resistance or for their antimicrobial properties . It has been shown that Zinc Oxide nanoparticles can decrease the antibiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vitro . Nanoparticles can interfere with the different proteins which are interacting in the antibiotic resistance or pharmacologic mechanisms of drugs . Another example is Silver which has been used for the treatment of burns and chronic wounds . Antibacterial and antifungal properties of nanoparticles have widened their applications in medicine and dentistry. # Immune response # Buckyballs have been investigated for the ability to interrupt the allergy/immune response by preventing mast cells ( which cause allergic response ) from releasing histamine into the blood and tissues , by binding to free radicals dramatically better than any anti-oxidant currently available , such as vitamin E . In February 2013 , University of Pennsylvania researchers developed a way to prevent nano particles from triggering an immune system response ; which could aid the delivery of medicinal nanoparticles some time in future . This is done by using the protein CD47 , found on most mammalian cell membranes which binds to the SIRPa in macrophages ; preventing an immune response from being triggered . # Arthroscope # Nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes , which are pencil-sized devices that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do the surgeries with smaller incisions . The smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients . It is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair . # Diagnostic and medical devices # Nanotechnology-on-a-chip is one more dimension of lab-on-a-chip technology . Magnetic nanoparticles , bound to a suitable antibody , are used to label specific molecules , structures or microorganisms . Gold nanoparticles tagged with short segments of DNA can be used for detection of genetic sequence in a sample . Multicolor optical coding for biological assays has been achieved by embedding different-sized quantum dots into polymeric microbeads . Nanopore technology for analysis of nucleic acids converts strings of nucleotides directly into electronic signatures . *C-dots ( Cornell dots ) are the smallest silica-based nanoparticles with the size **62628;7509;10 scriptstyle x </math> is given and the cost function to be minimized , that can be any function of the data <math> scriptstyle x </math> and the network 's output , <math> scriptstyle f </math> . The cost function is dependent on the task ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a priori ' ' assumptions ( the implicit properties of our model , its parameters and the observed variables ) . As a trivial example , consider the model <math> scriptstyle f(x) = a </math> where <math> scriptstyle a </math> is a constant and the cost <math> scriptstyle C=E ( x - f(x)2 </math> . Minimizing this cost will give us a value of <math> scriptstyle a </math> that is equal to the mean of the data . The cost function can be much more complicated . Its form depends on the application : for example , in compression it could be related to the mutual information between <math> scriptstyle x </math> and <math> scriptstyle f(x) </math> , whereas in statistical modeling , it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data . ( Note that in both of those examples those quantities would be maximized rather than minimized ) . Tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised learning are in general estimation problems ; the applications include clustering , the estimation of statistical distributions , compression and filtering . # #Reinforcement learning# # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually not given , but generated by an agent 's interactions with the environment . At each point in time <math> scriptstyle t </math> , the agent performs an action <math> scriptstyle yt </math> and the environment generates an observation <math> scriptstyle xt </math> and an instantaneous cost <math> scriptstyle ct </math> , according to some ( usually unknown ) dynamics . The aim is to discover a ' ' policy ' ' for selecting actions that minimizes some measure of a long-term cost ; i.e. , the expected cumulative cost . The environment 's dynamics and the long-term cost for each policy are usually unknown , but can be estimated . More formally the environment is modelled as a Markov decision process ( MDP ) with states <math> scriptstyle s1 , ... , snin S </math> and actions <math> scriptstyle a1 , ... , am in A </math> with the following probability distributions : the instantaneous cost distribution <math> scriptstyle P(ctst) </math> , the observation distribution <math> scriptstyle P(xtst) </math> and the transition <math> scriptstyle P ( st+1st , at ) </math> , while a policy is defined as conditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two then define a Markov chain ( MC ) . The aim is to discover the policy that minimizes the cost ; i.e. , the MC for which the cost is minimal . ANNs are frequently used in reinforcement learning as part of the overall algorithm . Dynamic programming has been coupled with ANNs ( Neuro dynamic programming ) by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis and applied to multi-dimensional nonlinear problems such as those involved in vehicle routing , natural resources management or medicine because of the ability of ANNs to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of the original control problems . Tasks that fall within the paradigm of reinforcement learning are control problems , games and other sequential decision making tasks . # Learning algorithms # Training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models ( or , in a Bayesian framework , determining a distribution over the set of allowed models ) that minimizes the cost criterion . There are numerous algorithms available for training neural network models ; most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and statistical estimation . Most of the algorithms used in training artificial neural networks employ some form of gradient descent . This is done by simply taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to the network parameters and then changing those parameters in a gradient-related direction . Evolutionary methods , These networks have also been used to diagnose prostate cancer . The diagnoses can be used to make specific models taken from a large group of patients compared to information of one given patient . The models do not depend on assumptions about correlations of different variables . Colorectal cancer has also been predicted using the neural networks . Neural networks could predict the outcome for a patient with colorectal cancer with more accuracy than the current clinical methods . After training , the networks could predict multiple patient outcomes from unrelated institutions . # Neural networks and neuroscience # Theoretical and computational neuroscience is the field concerned with the theoretical analysis and the computational modeling of biological neural systems . Since neural systems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behavior , the field is closely related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to create models of biological neural systems in order to understand how biological systems work . To gain this understanding , neuroscientists strive to make a link between observed biological processes ( data ) , biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning ( biological neural network models ) and theory ( statistical learning theory and information theory ) . # #Types of models# # Many models are used in the field , defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems . They range from models of the short-term behavior of individual neurons , models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems . These include models of the long-term , and short-term plasticity , of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level . # Neural network software # Neural network software is used to simulate , research , develop and apply artificial neural networks , biological neural networks and , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Types of artificial neural networks # Artificial neural network types vary from those with only one or two layers of single direction logic , to complicated multiinput many directional feedback loops and layers . On the whole , these systems use algorithms in their programming to determine control and organization of their functions . Most systems use weights to change the parameters of the throughput and the varying connections to the neurons . Artificial neural networks can be autonomous and learn by input from outside teachers or even self-teaching from written-in rules . # Theoretical properties # # Computational power # The multi-layer perceptron ( MLP ) is a universal function approximator , as proven by the Cybenko theorem . However , the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of the weights . Work by Hava Siegelmann and Eduardo D. Sontag has provided a proof that a specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights ( as opposed to full precision real number-valued weights ) has the full power of a Universal Turing Machine to detecting credit card fraud . Technology writer Roger Bridgman commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks , for instance , are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven , ( what has n't ? ) but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked : the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be an opaque , unreadable table ... valueless as a scientific resource . In spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology , Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers . An unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having . # In response to this kind of criticism , one should note that although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult , it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network . Furthermore , researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic principles which allow a learning machine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 ) wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning , as well as shallow vs deep architecture . Some other criticisms came from believers of hybrid models ( combining neural networks and symbolic approaches ) . They advocate the intermix of these two approaches and believe that hybrid models can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind ( Sun and Bookman , 1990 ) . **22;70143;gallery **25;70167;TOOLONG single-layer feedforward artificial neural network .
