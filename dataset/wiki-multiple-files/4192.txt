@@40920514 currentteam = Retired Seamus Patrick McGrath ( born March 5 , 1976 in Mississauga , Ontario ) is a retired Canadian professional mountain biker . Riding the sport for more than 15 years as a member of the Canadian national team , McGrath has won two medals in mountain biking at the Commonwealth Games ( 2002 and 2006 ) , and later represented his nation Canada in two editions of the Olympic Games ( 2004 and 2008 ) . Before retiring to focus on and organize the annual Tour de Victoria race in late 2008 , McGrath also trained and raced professionally for Haro-Lee Dungaree and Fuji Bikes under an exclusive sponsorship contract . McGrath made his official debut at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester , England , where he joined his teammate Roland Green to take the silver medal and climb on top of the podium for Canada with a spectacular 12 finish . When he first competed for Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , McGrath scored a career-high , ninth place in the men 's cross-country race with a time of 2:20:33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two years later , McGrath continued to set another sterling record by picking up the bronze in the same tournament ( 2:13:43 ) at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne , Australia , trailing behind the British duo Liam Killeen and Oliver Beckingsale within a short riding distance . At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , McGrath qualified for his second Canadian squad , as a 32-year-old senior , in the men 's cross-country race by receiving one of the nation 's three available berths from the Canadian Cycling Association and the International Cycling Union , based on his best performance at the World Cup series , World Championships , and Mountain Biking World Series . McGrath could not match a stellar performance from Athens , as he suffered a tyre puncture and then had to ride the rim all the way around the tech zone in order to replace the flat tyre . Realizing that his new wheel contained a slow leak at the designated site , McGrath decided to end his course with only three laps left and a forty-fourth place finish .
