@@31367514 The TshuapaLomamiLualaba Conservation Landscape ( TL2 ) was until very recently a remarkably unknown forested region in central Democratic Republic of Congo . # Geography # This landscape is known by three principal rivers , the Tshuapa , the Lomami , and the Congo River , known here as the Lualaba , giving the region its name : TL2 . The Tshuapa and Lualaba are its western and eastern borders ; the Lomami River flows through its center . This region covers over 40,000 km and is one of the largest blocks of intact forest in DRCongo . It has both low human population densities and little immigration . # Fauna # The most important populations of key fauna , including bonobo and elephant , occur in a central area that can be divided into three linked conservation sectors . Two primary conservation sectors , include one in Maniema Province and one in Orientale Province . Along with a third smaller sector in Kasai Oriental , surveys show that this region holds a major population of Congo 's great ape , the bonobo , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers . The concentrations of these two flagship species also correspond with the highest concentrations of many other large mammals , including primates , throughout this continuously forested landscape . The forests in the Lomami-Lualaba watersheds are the eastern range limit of Congos endemic great ape , the bonobo ( ' ' Pan Paniscus ' ' ) . Bonobos are found throughout most of TL2 , though occurrence is patchy and bonobos are uncommon in some areas where they are present . The largest concentrations of bonobos are found in the south of the landscape , toward the forest-savanna ecotone . Bonobos were recorded in only a few scattered locations in surveys outside the area defined as the TL2 Conservation Landscape , and the evidence suggests populations are small and scattered . Based on interviews with hunters and villagers , bonobos have disappeared from some of these areas over the last two decades as hunting levels increased . Forest elephants in the landscape are now restricted mainly to a single area in the watershed of the Tutu River , a tributary of the Lomami . It is an area of approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all highly mobile , occur elsewhere in the landscape . There is a reasonable prognosis for maintenance of forest elephants over the long term , but existing populations were nearly decimated after a decade of intense poaching , associated with the war and the widespread availability of military-grade firearms . Okapi occur on both sides of the Lomami River , representing an extension of the species known range . Okapi are , however , uncommon in the landscape . # Primates # Several species or subspecies of primates are limited in their distribution to the TL2 landscape region . A new species of primate , known vernacularly as the Lesula , was discovered in this region in 2007 . The Lesula is most closely related to the owl-faced monkey , ' ' Cercopithecus hamlyni ' ' . Significant work was subsequently undertaken over the next five years to complete the taxonomic classification of the new species and confirm the importance and significance of the discovery . On 13 September 2012 , the discovery of the lesula ( ' ' Cercopithecus lomamiensis ' ' ) was announced to have been confirmed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genomic evidence . # References #
