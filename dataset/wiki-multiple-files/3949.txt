@@37826514 ' ' Free Dimensional ' ' , released on October 23 , 2012 , is the second album from Canadian musician Diamond Rings ( real name : John O'Regan ) . According to O'Regan , his Diamond Rings persona exists to sort of smash that kind of tendency that I think we all have to sort of hide behind ourselves . And I think this record 's probably , or definitely , my strongest statement that I 've made to date . He also says a big part of this album was becoming more comfortable as a musician and a composer and an arranger , and I felt like I really stepped up as a singer with this album , and Im really proud of that . O'Regan has stated that this album is more polished than ' ' Special Affections ' ' , but I did nt really change my approach lyrically or emotionally . I feel like theyre still conveying the same message , but just coated in a way that has a few more layers of gloss . Its like we spent a two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier dance orientation to his unique recording set-up : I had a sit-down desk and I got rid of it cause I started working all day on these songs and I started feeling really sluggish , like I was a banker or something . So I got rid of the desk , put my computer up , and started recording like that . And it just all has a more dance-ready feel because I was dancing when I was making it ! O'Regan has compared ' ' Special Affections ' ' to ' ' Free Dimensional ' ' : The old album is more introspective , whereas Free Dimensional seems outrospective . It 's got all this energy coming out of it . # Track listing #
