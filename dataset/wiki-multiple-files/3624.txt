@@33679514 Atlantic stargazer ( ' ' Uranoscopus scaber ' ' ) is a marine , subtropical fish of family Uranoscopidae . Its body is suited for living on the sea floor , and is one of few fish capable of bioelectrogenesis , or the ability to generate an electric charge . # Distribution and habitat # It is widespread along the Atlantic coast of Europe and Africa , is very common in the Mediterranean and Black Sea , and somewhat rare in the Bay of Biscay . It is a demersal fish , which lives in sandy or muddy sand sediments along the upper slope of the continental shelf , between depths of 14-400 meters . It is not an economically important fish , primarily caught as by-catch , but is ecologically important . # Description # Typical of stargazers , its body is somewhat dorso-ventrally flattened , lacks a swimbladder , and have been found as large as 35.0 centimeters in length , but is usually between 20-30 cm . Its head and jaws are rotated upward , and has very large eyes and mouth . Its body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots , with a lighter belly . It lives to about 5 or 6 years , and females are larger in size than males . # Biology # # Feeding # Like other stargazers , it is an ambush predator which lies buried under sand with only its eyes showing . It has a large mouth , with a small strip of skin protruding from its lower jaw , which it moves in and out rapidly to act as a lure for prey . When a prey item comes near , the fish lunges toward the prey using a specially adapted vertebral column to generate the force by bending 60 , which takes less than 30 milliseconds to engulf the prey . It feeds primarily on fish larvae and smaller fishes , such as gobies , picarels , and small crustaceans , but has also been known to eat molluscs , echinoderms , annelids , algae and plant material . # Reproduction # They can spawn between April and September , depending on the region , and produce pelagic eggs , about 2 millimeters in diameter . After hatching , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are slightly more common than females , but this can vary within local populations . # Electric organ # All species within the ' ' Uranoscopus ' ' genus , along with those in ' ' Astroscopus ' ' , have evolved electric organs , but lack receptor organs . These were both independently evolved , and are the only two genera within the order Perciformes to produce electric organ discharges ( EODs ) . The atlantic stargazer , like other bioelectrogenic stargazers , produces pulse-type EODs while feeding and when it is disturbed . The atlantic stargazer produces EODs with the electric organ , derived from sonic muscles . In other fishes , sonic muscles are used to produce sound by agitating the swim bladder . # References #
