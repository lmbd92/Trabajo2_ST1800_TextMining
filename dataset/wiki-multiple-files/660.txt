He played just 11 games before moving to Parma in 1994 . His limited playing time with them persuaded him to move to Padova for the following season , where he scored 1 goal in 24 games . In the 199697 season , Fiore moved to Chievo , where he was impressive , notching up 2 goals and plenty of assists . This prompted former club , Parma , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons they left Fiore mainly on the bench , yet when he was given a chance he looked far more impressive than the aging Dino Baggio. # Udinese # In June 1999 he moved to Udinese , originally a cash-plus-player deal in which Parma would receive Stephen Appiah and Mrcio Amoroso , for a combined 90 billion lire transfer fees to Udinese , Fiore priced as 15 billion and the rest as cash . His career improved during the season . Here he scored 9 goals in 33 appearances . His fine form earned him a call to the national side for Euro 2000 at the expense of Dino Baggio , the man who had kept him out of the Parma team for so long . He had a very successful tournament and scored what many regard as the goal of the tournament in the 20 victory over Belgium . His fine form continued and he scored 9 goals in 34 games in 200001 season . # Lazio # Eventually , Fiore did move to Lazio in June 2001 along with teammate Giuliano Giannichedda , for a deal over 80 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they sold midfielder Juan Sebastin Vern and Pavel Nedvd that month ( June ) , and sold striker Marcelo Salas to Juventus for cash and Darko Kovaevi . They also got Jaap Stam to compensate part of Vern 's transfer fees and signed Gaizka Mendieta from Valencia . Fiore could not find his best form for Lazio as coach Alberto Zaccheroni persisted in playing him on the left side of midfield . This resulted in Fiore losing his place in the national side for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan . Zaccheroni was dismissed in 2002 , and Fiore began to improve with a new coach , Roberto Mancini . Fiore seemed more at ease playing in the centre of midfield and guided Lazio to fourth in Serie A , thus earning them a place in next season 's UEFA Champions League . Fiore was in good form for Lazio the following season , despite the loss of several key players in the summer ( and then Dejan Stankovi in January 2004 ) .

However , Fiore was used sparingly by coach Giovanni Trapattoni , who preferred to play the Argentine born winger , Mauro Camoranesi . When he did start , the Azzurri looked a lot more creative , with Fiore nearly scoring from a spectacular volley against Bulgaria in the final group game . Despite the Azzurri winning this match , the damage was done in the 2 previous group games , and Italy exited the tournament early . # Valencia # Due to the financial problems which Lazio were suffering , Fiore , along with Bernardo Corradi , were off-loaded to Spanish club Valencia , where he joined with the Italian coach Claudio Ranieri , signing a 3+1 years contract . Corradi was priced at 10 million and Fiore at6.6 million . The sale compensated the unpaid 16.6 million of Gaizka Mendieta 's remaining transfer fees from Valencia to Lazio . After a promising start , Valencia suffered a disastrous losing streak in October , from which they never fully recovered .

They had lost Enzo Maresca and holding midfielder Christian Obodo earlier in June . Fiore linked up well with striker Luca Toni , and together they brought Fiorentina to a higher level , guiding them to 4th in Serie A , before the Calciopoli verdicts saw them lose this place . Fiorentina decided not to take Fiore on a permanent basis and he sealed a loan move to Torino , who were returning to Serie A , on deadline day . On January 31 , 2007 , the closing day of the transfer window , he was loaned to Livorno . On February 11 , 2007 he played his first Serie A match for Livorno against A.C.
