@@28702514 During the 200001 English football season , Coventry City F.C . competed in the FA Premier League . # Season summary # Coventry City 's season started promisingly . Despite an opening-day 3-1 home defeat to Middlesbrough , this was followed by back-to-back away victories at Southampton and Manchester City , the first time they won an away league game in 16 months . However , after 34 years and 10 close shaves with relegation , their luck finally ran out and they were relegated from the top flight ( the first time the club had suffered relegation for 43 years since they were relegated to the Old Division Four in 1958 ) . Much optimism followed Coventry 's relegation with everyone at the club working hard to attain promotion at the first attempt . These hopes were boosted with the signing of prolific striker Lee Hughes from local rivals West Bromwich Albion . # Final league table # cellspacing= 1 cellpadding= 1 style= border:1px solid #fff ; background : #fff ; width:500px ; !
