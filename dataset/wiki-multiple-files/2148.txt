There were two aerial tramways connecting the mine to Romley , Colorado and the Denver , South Park and Pacific Railroad . In 1984 the Historic American Engineering Record recorded the structures then standing in the area . Drainage from the old mine into Chalk Creek , a tributary of the Upper Arkansas River , would sometimes cause fish kills at the state-run fish hatchery downstream , such as the kill of 800,000 fingerling trout in 1986 . The Colorado Division of Minerals and Geology consolidated all of the surface wastes and capped them in a high-and-dry spot on the mill site . This reduced the dissolved metals levels enough to keep the fish kills from recurring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new ways to treat harmful drainage from abandoned mines in the Colorado Rockies .
