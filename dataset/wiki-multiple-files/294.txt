The river drains a small rural and suburban region northwest of Boston . One of the most famous small rivers in U.S. history , it was the scene of an important early battle of the American Revolutionary War and was the subject of a famous 19th-century book by Henry David Thoreau. # Description # The river begins in Middlesex County , formed by the confluence of the Sudbury and Assabet rivers at Egg Rock , near the Concord town center . It flows generally north , from eastern Concord ( along the northwestern edge of the Boston metropolitan area ) , joining the Merrimack River from the south on the eastern side of Lowell . It is a gently flowing stream with little variation in topography along most of its route . Its drainage basin stretches into Worcester County and includes 36 towns within Massachusetts . Native Americans called it the ' ' Musketaquid ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation and its banks are fringed with wild grasses and sedges which stretch for miles along both sides of this placid stream . This creates a good environment for a variety of fish , including Bass , Shad , and Alewife ( River Herring ) , Pickerel , Carp , and American eel . Native Americans wove sticks in intricate designs to trap Alewives and other migrating fish at the mouths of rivers throughout this region . By 1635 , settlers from England began to arrive , and they gave the river its present name . On April 19 , 1775 , the Old North Bridge over the river in the town of Concord was famously the scene of the Battle of Concord , on the same day when the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired at nearby Lexington ) . The small wooden Concord Bridge ( a reproduction ) is preserved by the National Park Service . Henry David Thoreau wrote his first book , ' ' A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers ' ' , in 1849 while living at nearby Walden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers with his brother John , who had since died . Thoreau recounted his exploration of the natural beauty of the river , and his accompanied thoughts on such eternal themes as truth , poetry , travel , and friendship . Despite the growth of the suburbs in the vicinity of the river , it remains a popular canoeing destination today . The last mile of the river in Lowell is serious class 3+/4 whitewater. # Dams cause fish population to decrease # Dams were built along the Concord River to increase crop production and also to provide a source of power for operating mills . By the 19th century , the native population of shad and alewife became extinct , because the dams prevented the mature fish from returning upstream to spawn . Alewife and other anadromous fish are migratory . They hatch in fresh water , make their way to the sea to grow , then return as adults to fresh water to spawn , usually near where they had hatched . This instinct is imprinted within the fish when it is born . So , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Faulkner Dam in North Billerica is just one of many blockages that caused the alewife population to collapse on the Concord River . At this point , water was diverted north to Lowell and south to Charlestown to run the Middlesex Canal . # Effects of pollution # During the 19th century , the Concord River was near the heart of the US Industrial Revolution . Textile , paper , tanning , and mining industries all emerged during this period . Industrial wastes were dumped into the river , along with untreated sewage and other organic waste . Industrial development within the watershed peaked in the 1920s . The early 1960s saw an increase chemical and metal firms in support of the electronics industry within the Boston metropolitan area . By the 1960s , the Merrimack River was considered one of the top ten most polluted waterways in America . The Concord River empties into the Merrimack River . The passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 signaled the beginning of US efforts to improve the quality of its waterways . The act imposed stricter controls on point source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the installation of three wastewater treatment plants on the banks of the Concord River : one in Concord and two in Billerica . These plants have helped to prevent subsequent damage to the river ecosystem when they were able to operate within federally mandated limits . Pollutants such as heavy metals and PCBs remain trapped in the sediment . Throughout much of the Sudbury River and downstream into the Concord River , fish consumption is banned due to mercury-laden sediments from the Nyanza Superfund site and other sources . Perchlorate was detected in the Concord River in August 2004 . Initially , it was believed that explosives used in road and building construction were the source of this pollutant . However , an investigation by the town of Billerica eventually determined that the source was a local company that produced surgical and medical materials . The company was using 220 gallons per month of perchloric acid in a bleaching process , and rinse water was being discharged into the sewage system . After the company was identified , it voluntarily shut down until ion exchange equipment could be installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billerica was the subject of legal action and forced to pay a $250,000 penalty for discharging pollutants into the Concord River . The action was brought by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection ( MassDEP ) because the town of Billerica exceeded allowable effluent limits for phosphorus , fecal coliform bacteria , pH , and ammonia nitrogen . The town was also charged with failing to submit discharge monitoring reports , failing to comply with monitoring requirements , and failing to submit infiltration and inflow reporting . According to the EPA , Billerica 's discharges of phosphorus created an overabundance of nutrients , which damaged the river by stimulating excessive aquatic plant growth . # Recovery effort # In May 2000 , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , the Massachusetts Riverways Program , and volunteers from the Sudbury Valley Trustees ( SVT ) released 7,000 adult alewife ( river herring ) into the Concord River . They were transferred from the Nemasket River so that they could lay their eggs and spawn upstream . This imprinted the young alewives with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than 1000 juvenile alewives were observed in Heard Pond , located on the Sudbury River . Fishery biologists in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hope that after three to five years in the ocean , these fish will complete the cycle by swimming back to Heard Pond again . The fishery biologists say the fish will be able to swim over the top of North Billerica 's Faulkner Dam on the way downstream . However , on the return trip , the fish will need to be transported around the dam . If a sufficient number of fish return , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will explore options for a more permanent solution which may include modifications to the dam .
