@@18953514 A few years ago a new piece of liturgy was created to commemorate the Shoah and give Jews around the world a standard text to use each year on Yom Hashoah . Megillat Hashoah ( the Holocaust scroll ) presented a six chapter account of those dark days in a small booklet . Jews throughout the ages have told their stories using parchment and quills and so Sofer STaM Marc Michaels was commissioned by the former Rabbi of Brighton Synagogue to turn this booklet into a kasher scroll that could be read by the community on Yom Hashoah . Drawing on the power of the letters and scribal traditions to create a visual Midrash that adds further depth and meaning to the text , the scroll has been turned into a tikkun - a copyists guide - explaining the journey of the booklet to scroll and detailing the rules so that scribes over the world may create scrolls . The book describes a fascinating journey on the creation of the first new tikkun in thousands of years and hopefully the establishment of a new minhag to help ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megillat Hashoah was written by Marc Michaels , Sofer STaM with the authorisation of the Rabbinic Assembly and the Schecter Institute . It contains the entire unpointed text of the Megillat Hashoah and explanatory articles and notes .
