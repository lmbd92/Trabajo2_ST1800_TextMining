@@142514 Yeshivish ( ) , refers to a sociolect of English spoken by Yeshiva students and other Jews with a strong connection to the Orthodox Yeshiva world . # Research # Only a few serious studies have been written about Yeshivish . The first is a master 's thesis by Steven Ray Goldfarb ( University of Texas at El Paso , 1979 ) called A Sampling of Lexical Items in Yeshiva English . The work lists , defines , and provides examples for nearly 250 Yeshivish words and phrases . The second , more comprehensive work is ' ' Frumspeak : The First Dictionary of Yeshivish ' ' by Chaim Weiser . Weiser ( 1995 ) maintains that Yeshivish is not a pidgin , creole , or an independent language , nor is it precisely a jargon . He refers to it instead , with tongue-in-cheek , as a ' ' shprach ' ' , a Yiddish word meaning language or rapport . Baumel ( 2006 ) following Weiser notes that Yeshivish differs from English in three ways . Katz describes it in Words on Fire : the Unfinished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English , which is taking over as the vernacular in everyday life in some .. circles in America and elsewhere . Heilman ( 2006 ) and others consider code-switching a part of Yeshivish . Though Kaye ( 1991 ) would exclude English-speakers in the context of a Yeshiva , studying the Talmud , from code-switching where he considers the terms Yiddish English or Yiddishized English ( = Yinglish ) may be more appropriate . # Relation to other languages # # English # The English variant of Yeshivish consists of grammatical irregularities borrowed from Yiddish , and a vocabulary consisting of Yiddish , Rabbinic Hebrew , Talmudic Aramaic , and sometimes Modern Hebrew . The speaker will use those terms instead of their English counterpart , either because of cultural affinity , or lack of the appropriate English term . # Yiddish # The Yiddish variant of Yeshivish is questionable as a definition in itself , since the grammar remains identical to that of Yiddish . It may be argued that the Yiddish variant of Yeshivish is a new phenomenon , and consists of less Germanic terms and more Aramaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the secular and cultural variants of Yiddish , and may be attributed to the fact that YIVO , the forerunner of Yiddish as an academic study , was founded by Secular Jews who themselves were unlikely to be educated in Yeshivas and also removed by one or more generations from Yeshiva-educated speakers . However , the Yeshivish dialect of Yiddish has existed for quite a few centuries among Yeshiva-educated Jews in Eastern and Central Europe . However , as a result of the Holocaust , World War II and immigration , the secular-speaking Yiddish community is very small , and is far outnumbered by Religious Yiddish-Speaking communities in New York , Antwerp , Jerusalem , B'nei Beraq , London and others , making the predominant contemporary Yiddish Dialect that of the Yeshivish variant . # Hebrew # The Yeshivish dialect of Hebrew consists of occasional Ashkenazic pronunciation and various Yiddishisms within Modern Hebrew spoken among Haredi communities in Israel . While many terms from the Talmud and Mishna exist in Modern Hebrew , their pronunciation is in line with Modern Hebrew , whereas in the Yeshivish Variant , they maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in Yeshivish Hebrew , these are not distinct to the Yeshivish Dialect and can be found in mainstream Modern Hebrew as well . # Patterns of usage # Yeshivish is primarily a male spoken dialect . Fathers and sons , particularly of teenage years and above , might speak Yeshivish , while mothers and daughters generally do not , or they speak a milder variety of it . This can be explained as much of the yeshivish lexicon is learnt in Yeshivot where the studying takes place using a specialist nomenclature . Familiarity with these terms develops and they are then re-applied to other situations . There is a higher incidence of yeshivish being spoken amongst Orthodox Jews that are regularly involved in Torah study , or belong to a community that promotes its study . Commonly used platitudes amongst Orthodox Jews are frequently expressed with their Yeshivish equivalent . Examples include substituting ' ' Shkoikh ' ' for thank you , a contraction from the Hebrew Yashar Koach which literally translates as May your strength be firm and is used to indicate to someone that they have done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sometimes written as B H ) meaning Blessed is The Name of God . Yeshivish dialogue may include many expressions that refer to God or HaShem . Neophyte Orthodox Jews might overcompensate in their efforts to assimilate to the community 's parlance and speak a stilted artificial form of Yeshivish . Words might be used in an incorrect context and pronounced in an unusual manner . Another tendency of Baalei Teshuva is to cite excessive Godly references in their speech . Some observers predict that the English variant of Yeshivish may develop further to the point that it could become one of the historical Judeo-hybrid languages like Yiddish , Ladino or Judeo-Arabic . The Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular , Hebrew , Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms . As Yiddish was to Middle High German , Yeshivish may be to Standard American English . However , the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language as it did in the past . # Distinct features # # Vocabulary # The vocabulary and grammatical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native language ( see above ) , although it includes scholarly jargon , primarily from the Talmud and Acharonim in Yiddish , Hebrew , and Aramaic . In many sentences however , the grammatical and lexical features of the speaker 's native language is slight and sometimes even lacking altogether . A distinguishing feature of Yeshivish is that its speakers knowingly apply highly technical and literal written language to a colloquial language and in common day usage , similar to Modern Hebrew , for example : # He caused a lot of ' ' nezek ' ' , but ' ' l'basoif ' ' was ' ' moideh b'miktzas ' ' and claimed he was ' ' shoigeg ' ' # Nezek in its original context refers to the Talmudic notion of tort law , l'basoif means eventually , moideh b'miktzas refers to partial confession of a defendant , and shoigeg in its original context means an incident which was caused unwillingly , but was a result of partial negligence . Despite its heavy borrowing of technical and legal terms , the above sentence would be understood clearly by speakers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually admitted that he did it , although he claimed it was inadvertent . Note in the above example that ' ' shoigeg ' ' does not have the same meaning in Yeshivish as it does in its original context , wherein it implies negligence . ' ' oines ' ' would be the correct technical term , but it may be argued that there is less preference for ' ' oines ' ' in Yeshivish due to its meaning in Modern Hebrew of rape . # Phonology # The Yeshivish accent has similarities to various accents of Eastern European and New York backgrounds . One notable feature of Yeshivish is the frequency of occurrence of the phoneme x , common in many words of Hebrew , Aramaic , and Yiddish origin . /t/ may be released when in general American it would be flapped or unreleased . Final stops may devoice and pre-nasal // may not raise . # Discourse and prosody # Yeshivish may use a chanting intonation for reading and discussing Jewish texts . A number of other distinctive intonations are also used : for instance , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click is used , borrowed from Israeli Hebrew : : ' ' But sometimes it 's more - click I do n't know how to explain it . ' ' Yeshivish has some unique interjections . For instance ' ' Oh ! ' ' and ' ' Psshhhh ! ' ' may be used as praise markers. # Grammar # # #Morphology# # Loan words are often given plurals using standard English morphology . For instance , the plural of ' ' yeshiva ' ' is ' ' yeshivas ' ' rather than ' ' yeshivois ' ' as in Ashkenazi Hebrew ( although this is similar to the plural form in Yiddish ) . Hebrew nouns ending in ' ' -us ' ' are pluralized with the suffix ' ' -in ' ' rather than replacing ' ' -us ' ' with ' ' -uyois ' ' as in Ashkenazi Hebrew , e.g. ' ' shlichus shlichusin ' ' ' mission ' and ' ' mashmaus mashmausin ' ' ' implication ' . This likely comes from the Yiddish plural marker ' ' -n ' ' although it could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loan verbs may also conjugate with standard English patterns . For example , Yiddish derived ' ' daven ' ' ' pray ' may become ' ' davening ' ' or ' ' davened ' ' , e.g. I already davened mincha. and Quiet , I 'm davening. # #Syntax and semantics# # Some verbs , particularly those of Hebrew origin , are often treated as participles , and inflected by English auxiliary verbs , in the same way that periphrastic verbs are constructed in Yiddish . For example : : ' ' He was takeh moideh that he was wrong . ' ' : : ' He admitted that he was takeh ( indeed , actually ) wrong . ' : : ' ' He was ' ' puts ' ' moideh ' ' to admit into the third-person singular past tense : ' ' We 'll always be soimech on Rav Plony 's p'sak that the eruv is kosher . ' ' : : ' We 'll always rely upon Rabbi So-and-So 's ruling that the eruv is usable . ' : : ' ' We 'll always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely ' into the first-person plural future tense There are a number of phrasal verbs calqued from Yiddish , for instance ' ' bring down ' ' and ' ' tell over ' ' ' recount , retell ( a story ) ' . Modals may be used differently than in standard English , e.g. ' ' I want that you should get her number ' ' . There are a number of differences between the use of prepositions in Yeshivish and standard English : The preposition ' ' by ' ' has a wide array of meanings in Yeshivish : : ' ' Are you eating by Rabbi Fischer ? ' ' ( at the house of ) : ' ' By Chabad , it 's different . ' ' ( with , among ) A possible cause for this is that the Yiddish preposition ' ' bei ' ' defines as : at , beside or by . The similar sounding English preposition ' ' by ' ' has come to encompass these meanings . Prepositions are often dropped : : ' ' Her bus gets in 10:15 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years .
