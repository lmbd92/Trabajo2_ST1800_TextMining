@@39760514 Nigel Sears ( born April 4 , 1957 ) is a British tennis coach , best known for coaching former top five players Amanda Coetzer , Daniela Hantuchov and Ana Ivanovic during his long career . # Playing career # Sears reached a career high singles ranking of World No. 382 on January 4 , 1982 , and a career high doubles ranking of World No. 581 on January 2 , 1984 . He lost his only professional singles match , but won two of the ten professional doubles matches he played . # Coaching career # Nigel Sears started coaching Slovakia 's Daniela Hantuchov in 2001 . Under his guidance , Hantuchov reached the world 's top ten , won the prestigious Indian Wells tournament in California ( though that would be her only career title until exactly five years later ) and reached three consecutive Grand Slam quarter-finals between the 2002 Wimbledon Championships and the 2003 Australian Open ( losing twice to Serena Williams and once to Venus Williams respectively ) . It was during 2003 in which the coaching relationship between Sears and Hantuchov started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hantuchov lost a marathon second round match to Ashley Harkleroad in which she made over 100 unforced errors , which led to Sears publicly criticising her attitude . Having reached a career high ranking of World No. 5 earlier in the year , Hantuchov 's results continued to deteriorate and by the end of the year she had dropped to No. 17 , leading to a decision to temporarily split with Sears . Sears and Hantuchov reunited in 2004 , but on-court results did not improve , as Hantuchov further slipped down to World No. 54 before a late season resurgence saw her finish the season ranked World No. 31 and with an even win-loss record ( 24 wins and 24 losses ) . The pair split permanently in 2006 , after which Sears was appointed the captain of the Great Britain Fed Cup team . In June 2011 , Sears was appointed the head coach of former WTA World No. 1 Ana Ivanovic , with a view of reviving her ailing career . Since his appointment , Ivanovic 's performances at Grand Slam tournaments have improved , and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter-final at that level since winning the 2008 French Open . However , regular success has been hard to come by in recent times , with Ivanovic being unable to beat top ten players on a regular basis and having not won a title , let alone reached a final , since November 2011 , and having suffered many heavy defeats along the way ( Ivanovic has suffered five 60 set losses since July 2012 , including a double-bagel loss at the 2012 Rogers Cup ) . This led to questions being asked about Ivanovic 's progress since appointing Sears as coach in 2011 . Sears was sacked as Ivanovic 's coach following Wimbledon 2013 , in which Ivanovic was defeated in the second round by Eugenie Bouchard . The promise that Sears planned in trying to revive Ivanovic 's career was never delivered , as she was only able to win one title , regularly failed to beat players ranked above her and was bageled five times , in addition to failing to reach a single final in 2012. # Personal life # Sears resides in the south of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Sears , has been dating two times Grand Slam winner Andy Murray since 2005.
