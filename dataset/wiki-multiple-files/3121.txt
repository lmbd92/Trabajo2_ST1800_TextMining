@@28028514 The SogaMononobe conflict was a political and military dispute that took place in Japan during the Asuka Period between the pro-Shinto Mononobe clan , led by Mononobe no Moriya , and the pro-Buddhist Soga clan , led by Soga no Umako , which would eventually emerge victorious in the year 587 AD. # Background # # Battle at Mount Shigi # Although the circumstances under which the fighting took place are extremely murky , Takeshi Umehara notes that some ancient and medieval accounts say that the decisive battle took place in July of 587 near Mount Shigi . Between July 1st and 2nd the Soga are said to have been defeated in a series of engagements with the Mononobe , who , according to the ' ' Nihon Shoki ' ' , employed a type of fortification called an ' ' inaki ' ' , a palisade constructed from bundles of rice plants . The Soga gradually retreated westward and by July 3rd the demoralized Soga troops had finally concentrated in the area between Mount Shigi and Mount Ikoma .

Shotoku and Soga no Umako then both openly vowed to build a temple to the Four Heavenly Kings should they be victorious in the battle , which reenergized their men prior to the final confrontation . In this final battle the turning point came when a Soga archer , named by the ' ' Nihon Shoki ' ' as one Tomi no Obito Ichii , fired the arrow which killed Mononobe clan leader Mononobe no Moriya , after which his forces were quickly routed . The Mononobe clan , the most powerful opponent of Buddhism , was practically exterminated in the battle . Shotoku has traditionally been credited with the founding of two temples which he is said to have had constructed following the battle : Shitennoji and Shigisan Temple . # Notes # The name of Mount Shigi where the battle took place has been written as both ' ' Shigisan ' ' and ' ' Shigisen ' ' and for this reason the battle has been referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
