@@36720514 gridref = NW4111830995 Divis transmitting station is the main high-power UHF and BBC National FM/DAB station that serves County Antrim and parts of County Down . Situated just outside Belfast , it is the primary UHF/FM main station in Northern Ireland and was originally Northern Ireland 's main BBC 405-line television transmitter , coming into operation in this capacity on 21 July 1955 . As such , it was the first permanent television transmitter to be established within the island of Ireland . Although one of three UHF main stations in Northern Ireland , it is the only one to feature a stayed mast , the other stations at Brougher Mountain and Limavady both utilising smaller self-supporting towers . Stayed masts are however located at the UHF relay stations at Londonderry and Strabane ( respectively former BBC and ITA 405-line relays ) and at Black Mountain , the former ITA 405-line main station and current transmitter of Channel 5 that is sited adjacent to Divis . It is owned and operated by Arqiva . The Divis station is located in a range of hills directly overlooking Belfast from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was controlled by the Ministry of Defence , until it was sold in 2004 to the National Trust and subsequently opened to the public . It is sited between the peaks of Divis Mountain and Black Mountain and is ironically closer to the latter than the transmitter that is named after it . # Television history # Divis was opened by the BBC on 21 July 1955 as their permanent 405-line Band I transmission facility serving Northern Ireland . It superseded the temporary station at Glencairn , which was one of two transmitters ( the other being Pontop Pike ) to be rushed into operation on 1 May 1953 , in time for the televised Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . Although the BBC had by this time already obtained the Divis site , the need to construct the long access road was the primary factor preventing its immediate use for a provisional installation . Divis was designated as a medium-power transmitter , on which type of installation the second phase of BBC Band I stations were based . In this respect , Divis was grouped with permanent installations at Meldrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandale and Tacolneston . Transmissions from Divis were on VHF Channel 1 at a peak output of 35 kW vision e.r.p . In due course , a number of relay stations were established across Northern Ireland to enhance coverage from Divis , most notably at Brougher Mountain in County Fermanagh , the latter being the site of a future UHF main station . In the meantime , the Independent Television Authority ( ITA ) built their equivalent 405-line VHF Band III station close to Divis . Located at Black Mountain quarry , less than two miles to the south-west , this came into operation on 31 October 1959 and utilised a taller 750-ft mast . Divis however became the UHF main station for Belfast and surrounding area with BBC2 the first regular service commencing 18 March 1967 . Colour UHF transmitters for BBC1 and ITV came into operation in September 1970 . Both this site and Black Mountain are perhaps not surprisingly ( bearing in mind the area history ) dual ring-fenced for enhanced security . It has since been made public that the current transmitter mast ( 152.5 m ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new guyed steel mast ( 192.7 m ) . This meant for a period of time there were two broadcast masts at the site in preparation for the digital switchover in the Ulster region which occurred in October 2012 . Whilst this was certainly one of the plans , in reality a new 152m guyed mast has been constructed , and the original mast remains to carry the VHF and DAB services . By way of its extensive transmitter bases , Divis contributes significantly to the telecommunications network for much of Northern Ireland . # Services available # # Digital television # Digital television services broadcast on the following frequencies , and with the following powers : # #Before switchover# # # Analogue television # Analogue television services were broadcast on the following frequencies : All of the above channels , except TG4 , were broadcast at a power of 500 kW .
