The step-brothers hosted their music on a website , and began searching for a record label in order to release their music commercially . After sending demo tapes to White Lion Records , the duo was offered a record deal . The duo gained recognition for their controversial song Querido FBI , which responded to the killing of Filiberto Ojeda Ros , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after Querido FBI gained notoriety for Calle 13 , the band 's 2005 eponymously titled debut album was released and became commercially and critically successful in Latin America . The group was subsequently labeled as reggaeton , a genre that the duo wished to distance itself from . Visitante commented on the situation : The truth is that the first record had only four reggaetons . Those were the cuts used for promotional purposes , and so thats the brand that was put on us . But from the beginning , to me , reggaeton never offered anything musically . My brother liked it , yes , but we always tried to execute it in an organic way , with real instruments and mixing it with other genres. # Recording # While writing ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' , the duo took a trip to South America to explore areas populated by Latin America 's indigenous and African-descended minorities . Residente reflected on the journey , stating , We saw horrible things , but also things that were incredibly beautiful . Some of the contrasts are really intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visitante discovered and purchased several new musical instruments on the trip including a quijada , a charango and a bombo legero , all of which were used on the song Llegale a Mi Guarida . Residente and Visitante felt that writing on the road was conducive to the group 's creative output . The group 's journeys were documented in a film entitled ' ' Sin Mapa ' ' , which debuted on July 29 , 2009 at the New York International Latino Film Festival and later was released on DVD . ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' was recorded in various countries , as the band was on tour during the making of the album . Residente explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of ' ' Calle 13 ' ' , and felt that the recording of ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' was a smoother process than the first : The main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities , more tools and more money . We were also on tour at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing during the travels , while my brother would write the music . Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song . He agreed , as he greatly admired La Mala 's work , and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become Mala Suerta Con el 13 . # Composition # # Music # On the record , the band wished to experiment more with live instruments and diverse styles of music . Margarita Diaz of ' ' NY Daily News ' ' referred to ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' as an exhilarating travelogue through the sounds and rhythms of South America . Visitante , who composed the music on the album , credits the musical diversity to his past . He began playing classical piano at age six , and at age 17 , he joined a varied array of bands and played saxophone and keyboards . ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' features more guest artists than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tego Caldern , La Mala Rodrguez and Orishas . The introduction to the album , as described by Elijah Wald of the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' , sounds like a lovely Baroque chorale - unless one speaks Spanish , in which case it becomes immediately evident that it 's an ornate canon of the filthiest words in Puerto Rican street slang . Tango del Pecado mixes tango and reggaeton , and has been referred to as tango-tn . The song features Argentinian music producer Gustavo Santaolalla and his Bajofondo Tango Club . Puerto Rican rapper Tego Caldern is featured on Sin Exagerar , which contains guitar influenced by surf rock . Additionally , the song Cumbia de los Aburridos is strongly influenced by Colombian cumbia music , featuring an accordion and a horn section . Un Beso De Desayuno mixes electronica , rap and bossa nova . # Lyrics # Residente described the album as more introspective and autobiographical than its predecessor . With the lyrics on the record , Residente aimed for authenticity , attempting to tackle subjects not typically discussed in conventional reggaeton . He explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is similar to watching a movie , in the sense that the album depicts real life events and uses profanity to evoke emotion in the listener . Leila Cobo of ' ' Billboard ' ' wrote that the lyrical content of ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' ranges from sophomoric humor to outright perversion . The song Mala Suerte Con el 13 , the group 's collaboration with La Mala Rodriguez , is a satire of the Latin macho attitude . He wished to defy and poke fun at traditional gender roles , citing feminist philosopher Judith Butler as an influence ; I wanted to record a duet between a guy who 's weak and inadequate , and a woman who 's a sexual psychopath and has all the power in the world . A complete mockery of macho stereotypes . In the same vein , Sin Exagerar parodies the misogyny that Residente felt had saturated the reggaeton scene . The album 's lead single , Tango del Pecado , is addressed to the parents of Residente 's then-girlfriend , former Miss Universe Denise Quiones , who did not approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions , and author Ed Morales observes that It 's a calling out of the morality of Latin America . It 's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and , you know , asking people to go on that journey . Tango del Pecado also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of Sbele el volumen a la msica satnica ( turn up the satanic music ) . Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction , saying , I never do something expecting something . I do things because I like them . El Avin Se Cae depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger . In Pal Norte , Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States . Commenting on the track 's lyrical themes , he explained I had wanted to do that theme because I think it is an important topic . And not just for the immigrants in the United States but all over . It is a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puerto Ricans . All the people leave one country for another for the same reasons . Although much of the album addresses immigration and moving to different countries , La Crema is a celebration of living in Puerto Rico . # Title and artwork # The album 's name was inspired by an experience from Residente and Visitante 's childhood . When they were children , Visitante would visit his brother at the Calle 13 ( 13th Street ) of the El Conquistador subsection of Trujillo Alto , Puerto Rico every week . Since the subsection is a gated community , visitors were routinely asked Residente o visitante ? ( Resident or visitor ? ) by a security guard when approaching the community 's main gate . Therefore , Visitante would identify himself as a visitor , while Residente would have to insist that he was a resident to clear the gate . The pair named themselves Calle 13 after the street their family 's house was on . The title is also meant to refer to the status of immigrants in the United States , a recurring theme on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canteen on her chest resembling the Sacred Heart of Jesus . Residente noted that the image represents Hispanic immigrants coming to the United States , in an attempt to both sanctify the immigrants and humanize the holy images common in Latin America . An image inside the CD booklet features Residente with stigmata in his hands . He noted that the photo is intended to portray Jesus as a regular guy who deals with struggles similar to those of people crossing borders . He further commented , Obviously , the art of the CD is not made for people who are used to seeing the guy with the chick in a bikini in a car with all her jewelry . We do n't come here to befuddle the people more . # Release and reception # # Chart performance # ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' debuted on the U.S. ' ' Billboard charts Tango del Pecado , the first single released from the album , reached number 14 on the ' ' Billboard ' ' Latin Rhythm Airplay chart .

Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic gave ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' 4 out of 5 stars , noting the disc 's diverse musical styles and unique lyricism : Residente is a gifted rapper who matches Eminem in terms of wit and playfulness while Visitante is a similarly gifted producer who creates multi-layered tracks that rarely sound alike . Andrew Casillas of Stylus Magazine gave the album an A- grade , calling it a trailblazing record . Casillas praised Residente 's rapping on the record , calling his performance a revelation and referring to the song Un Beso de Desayuno as the band 's most noble achievement : a fully formed reggaetn love song .

Olivia Muoz of ' ' The Philadelphia Inquirer ' ' referred to the record as weird , seductive , thought-provoking and hilarious all at once , and despite noting the unconventional lyrical themes , she deemed many of the songs to be surprisingly danceable . Phil Freeman of ' ' The Village Voice ' ' called the album more thoughtful and musically broad-minded than its predecessor , and noted that the album gave Residente a platform for a more explicit political consciousness than some might have predicted , referring to the songs Pal Norte and La Cumbia de los Aburridos .

In late-2009 , the Latin music website Club Fonograma named it the 5th best album of the decade . # Track listing # # Bonus tracks # # Chart positions # # Weekly charts # # Year-end charts # # Album certification #
