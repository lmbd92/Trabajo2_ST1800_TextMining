@@31598514 The Dedication of the Basilicas of the Apostles Peter and Paul is a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church , which is celebrated on 18 November . This feast combines the standard celebration of the dedication of a church for St. Peter 's Basilica and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls , which were both built by the Emperor Constantine the Great during the 4th century . These sites had already been visited by pilgrims for over a century when the basilicas were built to honor the apostles traditionally believed to have been buried there . The basilicas were originally joined by a colonnade , which was built despite the distance of several miles between them . Their significance in the Catholic Church is emphasized in the reference made to them in the obligation on Catholic bishops to make a ' ' Quinquennial visit ad limina ' ' in which they are required to go to the tombs of the Apostles in Rome every five years to report on the status of their dioceses or prelatures . This requirement was initially set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papal bull ' ' Romanus Pontifex ' ' , which established the norms for these visits . On 31 December 1909 , Pope Pius X decreed that a bishop needs to report to the pope an account of the state of his diocese once every five years , starting in 1911.
