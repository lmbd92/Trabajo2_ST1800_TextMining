@@15715514 The Nuclear Fuel Factory ( FCN ) is located near Resende , state of Rio de Janeiro , comprising three units , and has a production capacity of 280 tons of uranium per year . At present , FCN was modernized and produces at the Components and Assembly Unit the fuel rods and fuel elements needed for Brazilian nuclear reactors . The Reconversion and Pellets Production Unit is operating since 1999 with a capacity of 160 tons of UO2 pellets/year . The UO2 reconversion line uses the AUC process . The Nuclear Fuel Factory also produces other fuel element components , such as top and bottom nozzles , spacer grids and end plugs for export demands . Previously , Brazil supplied the uranium , which is transported to Canada where its converted into hexafluoride gas , and then to the United Kingdom for enrichment before it returns to Brazil for fabrication into fuel elements . The unit has an in-house nuclear safety program and an external one , for environmental monitoring . A nuclear accounting system , internally implemented , required by the Brazilian Nuclear Energy Commission ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IAEA ) continuously performs a balance of the material in processing with a precision reaching tenths of milligrams. # IAEA Inspections # By late 2003 the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) was negotiating with the Brazilian Government to ensure that the new uranium enrichment facility , due to begin operating in 2005 , was properly safeguarded . In April 2004 the Brazilian Government denied access for the IAEA inspectors to the uranium enrichment facility being built in Resende . The plant , scheduled to begin operation in October 2004 , remains subject to IAEA inspections aimed at making sure it is not used for producing weapons-grade material . In February and March 2004 Brazil refused to let IAEA inspectors see equipment in the plant , citing a need to protect proprietary information . The IAEA had dispatched inspectors to Resende who found significant portions of the facility and its contents shielded from view . Walls had been built and coverings are draped over equipment . By November 2004 the IAEA was able to reach an agreement in principle with the Brazilian government on a safeguards approach to verify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This approach would enable the IAEA to do credible inspections but at the same time take care of Brazil 's need to protect certain commercial sensitivity inside the facility .
