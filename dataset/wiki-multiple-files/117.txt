It is in the barony of Iffa and Offa West . # Location and access # For much of the twentieth century , Cahir stood at an intersection of two busy national roadways : the Dublin to Cork N8 , and the Limerick to Waterford N24 . The N8 was realigned in 1991 to run west of the town , while the old road through it was renumbered the R670 . Traffic from the N24 still left the town badly congested , however , until October 2007 when this road was also realigned to bypass Cahir to the north and east . The same road improvement scheme saw major changes to the N8 corridor : a new motorway , the M8 , was constructed west of the town between 2006 and 2008 .
