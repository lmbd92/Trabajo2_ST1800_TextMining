As a young man in Utah Territory , Woolley served as a courier and bodyguard for polygamous leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) in hiding during the federal crusade against polygamy . His career as a religious leader in his own right commenced in the early twentieth century , when he began claiming to have been set apart to keep plural marriage alive by church president John Taylor in connection with the 1886 Revelation . Woolley 's distinctive teachings on authority , morality , and doctrine are thought to provide the theological foundation for nearly ninety percent of Mormon fundamentalist groups . # Early life # Woolley was the third child of Mormon pioneer John W.

According to LDS Church records , Woolley was baptized a member of the church by his father on October 18 , 1868 , aged eleven , and ordained an elder by John Lyon on March 10 , 1873 . Nicknamed Noisy , the boisterous young Woolley frequently dominated ward Elders Quorum discussions . Late in life , he would claim to have received his endowments and been ordained an apostle by Brigham Young on March 20 , 1870 , aged thirteen . On January 5 , 1883 , Woolley married Sarah Ann Roberts in the Endowment House on Temple Square . They had nine children together between 1883 and 1905 : seven sons and two daughters . Woolley served as a Mormon missionary in the Southern United States from October 31 , 1887 , to October 6 , 1889 .

Hales , , Mormon History Association , 2003 . During this time , church authorities frequently stayed at the Woolley home in Centerville , Utah . On October 6 , 1912 , Woolley wrote the first known account of the reception of the 1886 Revelation , an enigmatic document in the handwriting of Church President John Taylor . The revelation ( first brought to public attention during the excommunication trial of John W. Taylor , the President 's son , an apostle who had refused to accept the cessation of polygamy ) declared firmly that the Lord had not revoked the New and Everlasting Covenant ( plural marriage ) nor will I , for it is everlasting . According to Woolley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrected Joseph Smith , founder of the church , at his father 's home in September 1886 . Woolley frequently reiterated this account for the remainder of his life , adding additional details over time . The version which has assumed canonical status among Mormon fundamentalists was compiled by Joseph W. Musser in 1929 , and includes the claim that Smith 's appearance was followed by an eight hour meeting on September 27 , 1886 , at which President Taylor put five men ( Woolley and his father , George Q. Cannon , Samuel Bateman , and Charles Henry Wilcken ) under covenant to ensure that no year passed by without children being born in the principle of plural marriage . According to Woolley , these five men , together with Taylor himself and later Lorenzo Snow or Joseph F. Smith , comprised a seven man Council of Friends holding apostolic authority above that of the LDS Church . This doctrinal claim gave hierarchical structure to the nascent fundamentalist movement , until that time an informal association of LDS dissidents . Woolley 's father , the aged John W. Woolley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization . The elder Woolley was excommunicated from the LDS Church for performing plural marriages in April 1914 . Woolley was excommunicated from the LDS Church in January 1924 for alleging that Church President Heber J. Grant and apostle James E. Talmage had taken plural wives in the recent past . Woolley variously claimed that he had learned of such behavior because he was employed by the United States Secret Service to spy on LDS Church leaders or because he had been commissioned by Brigham Young to learn of and keep track of activities pertaining to the battle for and against the fullness of the gospel , including Plural Marriage . The official reason for his excommunication was that he was found guilty of pernicious falsehood . Grant publicly denied Woolley 's claims in a General Conference of the church in April 1931. # Mormon fundamentalist leader # Most Mormon fundamentalists believe that , upon his father 's death on December 13 , 1928 , Woolley succeeded him as senior member of the Council of Friends , and thus President of the Priesthood or Prophet .

Musser , Charles F. Zitting , Dr. LeGrand Woolley , and Louis A. Kelsch , Jr . From at least December 1933 , when Lorin Woolley was critically ill , Leslie Broadbent was designated his Second Elder and successor . Woolley observed , Brother Leslie , you are to me as Oliver Cowdery was to the Prophet Joseph Smith , before Oliver Cowdery apostatized . Despite Woolley 's appointment , some contemporary fundamentalist groups , such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ( FLDS Church ) , believe that he was succeeded as Prophet by John Y. Barlow . Although Anderson finds evidence for only two marriages of Lorin Woolley , one to Sarah Ann Roberts in 1883 and another to Goulda Kmetzch in 1932 , Woolley himself claimed to have five wives living in April 1933 .

Potential candidates in this regard include Alice May , Sarah Viola , Lucy , and Elnora Woolley , whom Bishop argues had married Lorin by at least 1915 . Bishop also notes the possibility of Woolley having wed an anonymous wife in the Yucatn Peninsula , where he claimed to have been divinely translated or teleported on at least one occasion
