@@473514 In analytical mechanics , specifically the study of the rigid body dynamics of multibody systems , the term generalized coordinates refers to the parameters that describe the configuration of the system relative to some reference configuration . These parameters must uniquely define the configuration of the system relative to the reference configuration . The generalized velocities are the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates of the system . An example of a generalized coordinate is the angle that locates a point moving on a circle . The adjective generalized distinguishes these parameters from the traditional use of the term coordinate to refer to Cartesian coordinates : for example , describing the location of the point on the circle using x and y coordinates . Although there may be many choices for generalized coordinates for a physical system , parameters are usually selected which are convenient for the specification of the configuration of the system and which make the solution of its equations of motion easier . If these parameters are independent of one another , then number of independent generalized coordinates is defined by the number of degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generalized coordinates are usually selected to provide the minimum number of independent coordinates that define the configuration of a system , which simplifies the formulation of Lagrange 's equations of motion . However , it can also occur that a useful set of generalized coordinates may be ' ' dependent ' ' , which means that they are related by one or more constraint equations . # Holonomic constraints # If the constraints introduce relations between the generalized coordinates ' ' q <sub> i </sub> ' ' , i=1 , ... , n and time , of the form , : <math> fj ( q1 , ... , qn , t ) = 0 , j=1 , ... , k , </math> they are called ' ' holonomic ' ' . These constraint equations define a manifold in the space of generalized coordinates ' ' q <sub> i </sub> ' ' , i=1 , ... , n , known as the configuration space It can be advantageous to choose independent generalized coordinates , as is done in Lagrangian mechanics , because this eliminates the need for constraint equations . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unconstrained set . For example , when dealing with nonholonomic constraints or when trying to find the force due to any constraint , holonomic or not , dependent generalized coordinates must be employed . Sometimes independent generalized coordinates are called internal coordinates because they are mutually independent , otherwise unconstrained , and together give the position of the system . # Non-holonomic constraints # A mechanical system can involve constraints on both the generalized coordinates and their derivatives . Constraints of this type are known as non-holonomic . First-order non-holonomic constraints have the form : <math> gj ( q1 , .. , qn , dotq1 , .. , dotqn , t ) = 0 , j=1 , ... , k . </math> An example of such a constraint is a rolling wheel or knife-edge that constrains the direction of the velocity vector . Non-holonomic constraints can also involve next-order derivatives such as generalized accelerations. # Example : Simple pendulum # The relationship between the use of generalized coordinates and Cartesian coordinates to characterize the movement of a mechanical system can be illustrated by considering the constrained dynamics of a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass M hanging from a pivot point so that it is constrained to move on a circle of radius L. The position of the mass is defined by the coordinate vector r = ( x , y ) measured in the plane of the circle such that y is in the vertical direction . The coordinates x and y are related by the equation of the circle : <math> f ( x , y ) = x2+y2 - L2=0 , </math> that constrains the movement of M. This equation also provides a constraint on the velocity components , : <math> dotf ( x , y ) =2xdotx + 2ydoty = 0 . </math> Now introduce the parameter , that defines the angular position of M from the vertical direction . It can be used to define the coordinates x and y , such that : <math> mathbfr= ( x , y ) = ( Lsintheta , -Lcostheta ) . </math> The use of to define the configuration of this system avoids the constraint provided by the equation of the circle . # Virtual work # Notice that the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual Cartesian coordinates , : <math> mathbfF= ( 0 , -mg ) , </math> where g is the acceleration of gravity . The virtual work of gravity on the mass m as it follows the trajectory r is given by : <math> delta W = mathbfFcdotdelta mathbfr . </math> The variation r can be computed in terms of the coordinates x and y , or in terms of the parameter , : <math> delta mathbfr = ( delta x , delta y ) = ( Lcostheta , Lsintheta ) deltatheta . </math> Thus , the virtual work is given by : <math> delta W = -mgdelta y = -mgLsinthetadeltatheta . </math> Notice that the coefficient of y is the y-component of the applied force . In the same way , the coefficient of is known as the generalized force along generalized coordinate , given by : <math> Ftheta = -mgLsintheta. </math> # Kinetic energy # To complete the analysis consider the kinetic energy T of the mass , using the velocity , : <math> mathbfv= ( dotx , doty ) = ( Lcostheta , Lsintheta ) dottheta , </math> so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) = frac12 m L2dottheta2. </math> # Lagrange 's equations # Lagrange 's equations for the pendulum in terms of the coordinates x and y are given by , : <math> fracddtfracpartial Tpartial dotx - fracpartial Tpartial x = Fx + lambda fracpartial fpartial x , quad fracddtfracpartial Tpartial doty - fracpartial Tpartial y = Fy + lambda fracpartial fpartial y . </math> This yields the three equations : <math> mddotx = lambda(2x) , quad mddoty = -mg + lambda(2y) , quad x2+y2 - L2=0 , </math> in the three unknowns , x , y and . Using the parameter , Lagrange 's equations take the form : <math> fracddtfracpartial Tpartial dottheta - fracpartial Tpartial theta = Ftheta , </math> which becomes , : <math> mL2ddottheta = -mgLsintheta , </math> or : <math> ddottheta + fracgLsintheta=0 . </math> This formulation yields one equation because there is a single parameter and no constraint equation . This shows that the parameter is a generalized coordinate that can be used in the same way as the Cartesian coordinates x and y to analyze the pendulum . # Example : Double pendulum # The benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double pendulum . For the two masses m <sub> i </sub> , i=1 , 2 , let r <sub> i </sub> = ( x <sub> i </sub> , y <sub> i </sub> ) , i=1 , 2 define their two trajectories . These vectors satisfy the two constraint equations , : <math> f1 ( x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ) = mathbfr1cdot mathbfr1 - L12 = 0 , quad f2 ( x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ) = ( mathbfr2-mathbfr1 ) cdot ( mathbfr2-mathbfr1 ) - L22 = 0 . </math> The formulation of Lagrange 's equations for this system yields six equations in the four Cartesian coordinates x <sub> i </sub> , y <sub> i </sub> i=1 , 2 and the two Lagrange multipliers <sub> i </sub> , i=1 , 2 that arise from the two constraint equations . # Coordinates # Now introduce the generalized coordinates <sub> i </sub> i=1,2 that define the angular position of each mass of the double pendulum from the vertical direction . In this case , we have : <math> mathbfr1 = ( L1sintheta1 , -L1costheta1 ) , quad mathbfr2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -L2costheta2 ) . </math> The force of gravity acting on the masses is given by , : <math> mathbfF1= ( 0 , -m1 g ) , quad mathbfF2= ( 0 , -m2 g ) </math> where g is the acceleration of gravity . Therefore , the virtual work of gravity on the two masses as they follow the trajectories r <sub> i </sub> , i=1,2 is given by : <math> delta W = mathbfF1cdotdelta mathbfr1 + mathbfF2cdotdelta mathbfr2 . </math> The variations r <sub> i </sub> i=1 , 2 can be computed to be : <math> delta mathbfr1 = ( L1costheta1 , L1sintheta1 ) deltatheta1 , quad delta mathbfr2 = ( L1costheta1 , L1sintheta1 ) deltatheta1 + ( L2costheta2 , L2sintheta2 ) deltatheta2 </math> # Virtual work # Thus , the virtual work is given by : <math> delta W = **31;943;TOOLONG - **25;976;TOOLONG , </math> and the generalized forces are : <math> Ftheta1 = -(m1+m2)gL1sintheta1 , quad Ftheta2 = -m2gL2sintheta2. </math> # Kinetic energy # Compute the kinetic energy of this system to be : <math> T= frac12m1 mathbfv1cdotmathbfv1 + frac12m2 mathbfv2cdotmathbfv2 = **26;1003;TOOLONG + frac12m2L22dottheta22 + m2L1L2 **36;1031;TOOLONG </math> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equations in the unknown generalized coordinates <sub> i </sub> i=1 , 2 , given by : <math> ( m1+m2 ) **48;1069;TOOLONG + **35;1119;TOOLONG = -(m1+m2)gL1sintheta1 , </math> and : <math> **50;1156;TOOLONG + **51;1208;TOOLONG . </math> The use of the generalized coordinates <sub> i </sub> i=1 , 2 provides an alternative to the Cartesian formulation of the dynamics of the double pendulum . Constraints on the velocity system with <math> m </math> degrees of freedom ( physics and chemistry ) : <math> mathbfr1=mathbfr1 ( q1 , q2 , ... , qm , t ) </math> , : <math> mathbfr2=mathbfr2 ( q1 , q2 , ... , qm , t ) </math> , ... : <math> mathbfrn=mathbfrn ( q1 , q2 , ... , qm , t ) </math> . This transformation affords the flexibility in dealing with complex systems to use the most convenient and not necessarily inertial coordinates . These equations are used to construct differentials when considering virtual displacements and generalized forces . -- # Examples # # Double pendulum # A double pendulum constrained to move in a plane may be described by the four Cartesian coordinates ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' <sub> 1 </sub> , ' ' x ' ' <sub> 2 </sub> , ' ' y ' ' <sub> 2 </sub> , but the system only has two degrees of freedom , and a more efficient system would be to use : <math> lbrace q1 , q2 rbrace = lbracetheta1 , theta2 rbrace </math> , which are defined via the following relations : : <math> lbrace x1 , y1 rbrace = lbrace L1sintheta1 , L1costheta1 rbrace </math> : <math> lbrace x2 , y2 rbrace = lbrace L1sintheta1+L2sintheta2 , L1costheta1+L2costheta2 rbrace </math> # Example : Bead on a wire # A bead constrained to move on a wire has only one degree of freedom , and the generalized coordinate used to describe its motion is often : <math> q1= l </math> , where ' ' l ' ' is the distance along the wire from some reference point on the wire . Notice that a motion embedded in three dimensions has been reduced to only one dimension . # Motion on a surface # A point mass constrained to a surface has two degrees of freedom , even though its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sphere , a good choice of coordinates would be : : <math> lbrace q1 , q2 rbrace = lbrace theta , phi rbrace </math> , where and are the angle coordinates familiar from spherical coordinates . The ' ' r ' ' coordinate has been effectively dropped , as a particle moving on a sphere maintains a constant radius . -- # Generalized velocities and kinetic energy # Each generalized coordinate <math> qi </math> is associated with a generalized velocity <math> dot qi </math> , defined as : : <math> dot qi=dqi over dt </math> The kinetic energy of a particle is : <math> T = frac m2 left ( dot x2 + dot y2 + dot z2 right ) </math> . In more general terms , for a system of <math> p </math> particles with <math> n </math> degrees of freedom , this may be written : <math> T =sumi=1 p frac mi2 left ( dot xi2 + dot yi2 + dot zi2 right ) </math> . If the transformation equations between the Cartesian and generalized coordinates : <math> xi = xi left ( q1 , q2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yi = yi left ( q1 , q2 , ... , qn , t right ) </math> : <math> zi = zi left ( q1 , q2 , ... , qn , t right ) </math> are known , then these equations may be differentiated to provide the time-derivatives to use in the above kinetic energy equation : : <math> dot xi = frac ddt xi left ( q1 , q2 , ... , qn , t right ) . </math> It is important to remember that the kinetic energy must be measured relative to inertial coordinates . If the above method is used , it means only that the Cartesian coordinates need to be inertial , even though the generalized coordinates need not be . This is another considerable convenience of the use of generalized coordinates . -- # Applications of generalized coordinates # Such coordinates are helpful principally in Lagrangian mechanics , where the forms of the principal equations describing the motion of the system are unchanged by a shift to generalized coordinates from any other coordinate system . The amount of virtual work done along any coordinate <math> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = Fqi cdot delta qi </math> , </center> where <math> Fqi </math> is the generalized force in the <math> qi </math> direction . While the generalized force is difficult to construct ' a priori ' , it may be quickly derived by determining the amount of work that would be done by all non-constraint forces if the system underwent a virtual displacement of <math> delta qi </math> , with all other generalized coordinates and time held fixed . This will take the form : : <math> delta Wqi = f left ( q1 , q2 , ... , qn right ) cdot delta qi </math> , and the generalized force may then be calculated : : <math> Fqi = frac delta Wqidelta qi = f left ( q1 , q2 , ... , qn right ) </math> . -- # Generalized coordinates and virtual work # The ' ' principle of virtual work ' ' states that if a system is in static equilibrium , the virtual work of the applied forces is zero for all virtual movements of the system from this state , that is , W=0 for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is equivalent to the requirement that the generalized forces for any virtual displacement are zero , that is ' ' F ' ' <sub> i </sub> =0 . Let the forces on the system be F <sub> j </sub> , ' ' j=1 , ... , m ' ' be applied to points with Cartesian coordinates r <sub> j </sub> , j=1 , ... , m , then the virtual work generated by a virtual displacement from the equilibrium position is given by : <math> delta W = sumj=1m mathbfFjcdot deltamathbfrj. </math> where r <sub> j </sub> , ' ' j=1 , ... , m ' ' denote the virtual displacements of each point in the body . Now assume that each r <sub> j </sub> depends on the generalized coordinates ' ' q ' ' <sub> i </sub> , ' ' i=1 , ... , n ' ' , then : <math> delta mathbfrj = fracpartial mathbfrjpartial q1 deltaq1 + ldots + fracpartial mathbfrjpartial qn deltaqn , </math> and : <math> delta W = left ( sumj=1m mathbfFjcdot fracpartial mathbfrjpartial q1right ) deltaq1 + ldots + left ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' n ' ' terms : <math> Fi = sumj=1m mathbfFjcdot fracpartial mathbfrjpartial qi , quad i=1 , ldots , n , </math> are the generalized forces acting on the system . Kane shows that these generalized forces can also be formulated in terms of the ratio of time derivatives , : <math> Fi = sumj=1m mathbfFjcdot fracpartial mathbfvjpartial dotqi , quad i=1 , ldots , n , </math> where v <sub> j </sub> is the velocity of the point of application of the force F <sub> j </sub> . In order for the virtual work to be zero for an arbitrary virtual displacement , each of the generalized forces must be zero , that is : <math> delta W = 0 quad Rightarrow quad Fi =0 , i=1 , ldots , n. </math>
