His younger brother Moray Callum is Ford Executive Director of Design , Americas . # Early years # Callum was born in Dumfries , Scotland , in 1954 . In 1968 ( at the age of 14 ) he submitted a car design to Jaguar in the hope of landing a job . Callum studied at Lanchester Polytechnic 's ( now Coventry University ) School of Transportation Design in Coventry , Aberdeen Art College and the Glasgow School of Art , where he graduated with a degree in Industrial Design . He subsequently graduated from the Royal College of Art in London with a post-graduate Masters degree in Vehicle Design . # Career # # Ford # From 1979 to 1990 , he worked at Ford working between Dunton , Japan , Italy and Australia , mainly working on bits of cars , mostly steering wheels . As well as working on bread-and-butter Fiestas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RS200 and Escort RS Cosworth , the last of which he is especially proud of and with which he collaborated with fellow RCA graduate Peter Horbury . He was then appointed Design Manager responsible for the Ghia Design Studio in Turin and worked on the Via , Zig and Zag show car concepts . # TWR # After eleven years in a corporate environment , Callum left Ford in 1990 to join Peter Stevens and Tom Walkinshaw to form TWR Design . He said , In 1991 , he was appointed Chief Designer and General Manager of TWR Design . During this period he was partially responsible for designing the Aston Martin DB7 , which is probably the design he is currently most famous for . He also designed the Aston Martin Vanquish , the V12-powered DB7 Vantage and Aston Martin 's Project Vantage concept car as well as taking responsibility for a wide range of design programs for other TWR clients , including Volvo , Mazda and HSV . He was awarded the Jim Clark Memorial Award in 1995 in recognition of his styling work on the DB7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # In 1999 , Callum was appointed to succeed the late Geoff Lawson as Design Director at Jaguar , which had become a Ford Motor Company subsidiary in 1990 . For a short stint , Callum directed design at both Jaguar and Aston Martin and it is claimed that he laid the foundations for the DB9 which was later finished by Henrik Fisker , though the extent of his contribution remains unclear . At Jaguar , since the Lawson designed 2001 X-Type and 2002 XJ were well advanced his influence was initially felt through a series of concepts , the 2001 R-Coupe and 2003 R-D6 . The first production Jaguar to bear his influence was the 2004 facelift of the S-Type followed by the 2004 X-Type Estate , of which he was responsible for the tailgate design . With the next generation of Jaguar models Callum took Jaguar away from the Lawson-era retroism , which produced the more traditional-looking X-Type , S-Type , and XJ , towards a new style . This began with the 2006 XK , which bears striking similarity to the Aston Martin DB9 , which Callum describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new direction is continued with the 2008 XF as previewed by the concept C-XF , which Callum describes as the ' next significant step forward ' in Jaguar 's design direction , and the 2010 XJ . He also oversaw the design for the 2010 C-X75 concept car and the 2013 F-Type . According to Callum , Jaguars should be perceived as cool cars and cool cars attract interesting , edgy people . The quality of Callum 's work at Jaguar has been acknowledged by twice Le Mans 24 hours winner and fellow Dumfries native , Allan McNish. # His concepts # **18;91300;gallery file:Ford RS200.jpgFord RS200 ( 1984 ) file:Ford Escort RS Cosworth silver.jpgFord Escort Cosworth ( 1989 ) file:DB7 Volante.jpgAston Martin DB7 ( 1993 ) **26;91320;TOOLONG R390 ( 1997 ) file:Ford Puma front.jpgFord Puma ( 1997 ) file:Amvanquish.jpg Aston Martin Vanquish ( 2001 ) file:Jaguar X-Type Estate rear 20080731. jpgJaguar X-Type Estate ( 2004 ) file:Aston Martin DB9 - Birmingham - 2005-10-14 ( 2 ) . jpgAston Martin DB9 ( 2004 ) file:Jaguar X150 front 20080223. jpgJaguar XK ( 2005 ) file:Jaguar XF 001 .
