@@6953514 The olive oropendola ( ' ' Psarocolius bifasciatus ' ' ) is the largest member of the Icterid family and rivals the Amazonian umbrellabird as the largest passerine bird in South America . It is sometimes placed in the genus ' ' Gymnostinops ' ' instead of ' ' Psarocolius ' ' . As suggested by its name , it is found widely but often in low densities throughout humid lowland forests of the Amazon Basin , with the notable exception of most of the Guiana Shield . It is sometimes split into two species , the western olive oropendola ( ' ' P. yuracares ' ' ) and the eastern Par oropendola ( ' ' P. bifasciatus ' ' ) , but the subspecies ' ' P. y. neivae ' ' is widely recognized as a hybrid swarm , and the vast majority of authorities consider them a single species . # Description # The sexes of this icterid are very different in size : the male is 52 cm ( 21 in ) long and weighs 550 g ( 1.2 lbs ) ; the smaller female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 260 g ( 9.2 oz ) . Confusingly , the name olive oropendola is usually used for this combined species , despite the fact that the nominate subspecies has no olive to its plumage , as its head and chest are black ( these are olive in ' ' P. b. yuracares ' ' ) . The back , wings and belly of this large oropendola are brown , the outer rectrices are yellow ( i.e. tail appears all yellow from below ) , the bare facial skin is pink , the eyes are brown , and the bill is black with an orange tip . The superficially similar green oropendola has an olive back and wing-coverts , lacks extensive bare facial-skin , has a pale bill with an orange tip , and blue eyes . # Behavior # The olive oropendola is a canopy bird that most often is seen flying high over the tops of the trees . Compared to other oropendolas it is a loner most frequently seen alone or in pairs , and drawing less attention to itself than its cousins , despite the greater size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other oropendolas . The breeding colonies are small , usually with fewer than five birds . The nest is a hanging woven ball fibers and vines , 60180 cm long , high in a tree . Relatively little is known about these bird 's breeding habits . The omnivorous diet appears to be fairly catholic . They may eat small vertebrates ( especially amphibians and reptiles ) , large insects , nectar , and fruit . They often travel great distances through the forests , except when lingering around their nesting colony . The song of the olive oropendola is a liquid , gurgling and expanding ' ' **26;23954;TOOLONG ' GLOOP ! ' ' , given as a displaying male falls forward on a perch and rustles his wings over the back . Nasal ' ' raap ' ' and ' ' whrup ' ' calls are given while in flight or when foraging .
