For the last decade he has been one of the most persistent voices warning of the inevitable effects of a major hurricane on the Louisiana coast . He was one of several hundred participants at the Hurricane Pam exercise in July 2004 . He claims that his warnings during the Hurricane Pam exercise were ignored , which may have contributed to the Hurricane Katrina disaster . He has also taken the Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) to task for their misdesigns which caused the Levee failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LSU told him not to talk to the media , amid concerns that his book The Storm was endangering federal grant money flowing to the university . ( ' ' The Storm ' ' , published in 2006 , offered his analysis of Katrina and the levee disasters . ) Van Heerden also alleged that the White House withheld information that the levees of New Orleans had broken . On 9 April 2009 LSU announced it would not renew van Heerden 's contract , effective the end of the spring semester 2010 . Van Heerden said he was not offered any reason . Van Heerden spoke to Harry Shearer on his Le Show radio program on 12 April 2009 and said , I learned about not being deputy director through the news media . They basically did n't have the guts to tell me that to my face ... They could n't tell me why and would n't tell me why . In an editorial letter to the Times-Picayune , Charles E. Settoon criticized Dr. van Heerden for allegedly offering engineering services and that he had represented himself as an engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he was a legal liability for his employer , LSU .

An especially tart assailment of LSU 's administration appeared in the New Orleans ' ' Times-Picayune ' ' , from attorney and adjunct professor in LSU-rival Tulane University 's School of Law , whose letter to the editor ended thus : : : Academic freedom and intellectual integrity are , at LSU , like two distant cousins who have n't spoken to each other in many , many years . : : Flagship university ?

The suit alleges the short-cut canal : : caused environmental degradation of the wetlands and greatly increased the effect of Katrina , causing the flooding in such areas as St. Bernard Parish and the citys Lower Ninth Ward . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said I think thats the timing to try to discredit me . In 2011 , the American Association of University Professors found that LSU violated van Heerden 's academic freedom . In February 2013 , LSU paid van Heerden $435,000 in settlement . An article in the ' ' Times-Picayune ' ' online edition , April 2013 , noted that LSU spent nearly $1 million in fees and other costs to complete the firing of van Heerden . In a two and half year court battle , LSU paid Baton Rouge law firm Kantro Spaht Weaver and Blitzer more than $457,000 . Later vindicated by other studies , the corp commanding Lt. Gen Carl Strock noted in 2006 , This has been sobering for us , because it 's the first time the corps has had to stand up and say we had a catastrophic failure with one of our projects . The ' ' Times-Picayune ' ' article also reported that Levees.org founder Sandy Rosenthal who investigated the reported costs incurred by LSU , noted that van Heerden ... tried to get the truth out about the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be suppressing the truth. # Quotes # * What bothers me the most is all the people who 've died unnecessarily . * Those FEMA officials would n't listen to me . Those Corps of Engineers people giggled in the back of the room when we tried to present information . *When it was suggested that tents be prepared . Their response to me was : ' Americans do n't live in tents , ' and that was about it . * As a nation , let 's take up the ' Rebuild ! ' battle cry . Now is the time to put politics , egos , turf wars and profit agendas aside . We owe it to the thirteen hundred Americans who died in the Katrina tragedy . We owe it to their survivors and to all future generations . It 's now or never .
