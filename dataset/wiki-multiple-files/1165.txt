@@6659514 Yuan Yong ( ) ( died May 17 , 528 ) , n Tuoba Yong ( ) , courtesy name Simu ( ) , formally Prince Wenmu of Gaoyang ( ) , was an imperial prince of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei . He was very powerful during the reign of his grandnephew Emperor Xiaoming , and by corrupt means grew very rich . This , however , drew resentment from the populace , and after Emperor Xiaoming 's death in 528 and the subsequent overthrowing of Emperor Xiaoming 's mother Empress Dowager Hu by the general Erzhu Rong , Erzhu had him and over 2,000 other officials slaughtered at Heyin ( , in modern Luoyang , Henan ) . # Background # It is not known when Tuoba Yong was born ; what is known is that he was the sixth of seven sons of Emperor Xianwen , and that his mother was Emperor Xianwen 's concubine Consort Han , who was also the mother of one of his older brothers , Tuoba Gan ( ) .

Emperor Xiaowen liked Tuoba Yong for his lack of inhibitions , and while Yuan Yong did not display much talent while young , he believed that Yuan Yong might show those talents later . In 485 , Tuoba Yong was created the Prince of Yingchuan . In 494 , when Emperor Xiaowen moved the capital from Pingcheng ( , in modern Datong , Shanxi ) , Tuoba Yong 's title was changed to the Prince of Gaoyang . In 496 , when Emperor Xiaowen changed the name of the imperial clan from Tuoba to Yuan , Tuoba Yong 's name was changed to Yuan Yong . Subsequently , when Emperor Xiaowen conducted his campaigns against rival Southern Qi , Yuan Yong was put in charge of the important Xiang Province ( , roughly modern Handan , Hebei ) , but he , unlike most of his other brothers , was not given any greater authority during Emperor Xiaowen 's reign . # During Emperor Xuanwu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly powerful , after Emperor Xiaowen 's death in 499 and succession by his oldest son Emperor Xuanwu , unlike his brothers Yuan Xi ( ) the Prince of Xianyang , Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng , and Yuan Xiang ( ) the Prince of Beihai , each of whom received substantial powers . After Yuan Yong served a further stint as the governor of Ji Province ( , modern central Hebei ) , Emperor Xuanwu recalled him to the capital . He participated in Yuan Xiang 's corruption trial in 504 . Whenever Emperor Xuanwu visited Yuan Yong 's mansion , Emperor Xuanwu would pay proper respect to him as an uncle , rather than allowing Yuan Yong to bow to him as a subject to an emperor . # During Emperor Xiaoming 's reign # Emperor Xuanwu died suddenly in 515 . The officials Yu Zhong and Cui Guang ( ) quickly proclaimed Emperor Xuanwu 's young crown prince Yuan Xu emperor ( as Emperor Xiaoming ) and seized power away from Emperor Xuanwu 's wife Empress Gao , whose uncle Gao Zhao , who was also Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to counteract Gao Zhao , Yu and Cui forced Empress Gao to yield regent powers to Yuan Yong and Emperor Xiaowen 's cousin Yuan Cheng ( ) the Prince of Rencheng , and then , Yu and Yuan Yong ambushed Gao Zhao and killed him . Empress Gao was also removed and replaced as empress dowager by Emperor Xiaoming 's mother Consort Hu . Although Yuan Yong and Yuan Cheng were titular regents , real regency powers were in Yu 's hands , and Yu quickly grew exceedingly arrogant and autocratic . The officials Pei Zhi ( ) and Guo Zuo ( ) secretly suggested to Yuan Yong to have Yu 's power stripped . When Yu found out about this , he falsely accused Pei and Guo of crimes , and they were put to death . Yu also wanted to kill Yuan Yong , but Cui resisted , so Yuan Yong was only removed from his posts . Later in 515 , however , Empress Dowager Hu assumed regency powers and quickly stripped Yu of most of his posts , making Yu the governor of Ji Province . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts were reversed , and Yuan Yong accused him of crimes and asked that he be punished . However , Empress Dowager Hu , because Yu had saved her life before , refused to act against Yu , although she recalled Yuan Yong back to the administration to serve in high capacity . During Empress Dowager Hu 's regency , she tolerated officials ' corruption and wealth-gathering , and often added to the wealth-gathering herself by awarding them money and luxuries out of the imperial treasury . Yuan Yong became exceedingly rich at this time , and historians described his wealth as being so great as like a nation 's treasury , and he had 6,000 male servants and 500 female servants . While two other princes , Yuan Chen ( ) the Prince of Hejian and Yuan Rong ( ) the Prince of Zhangwu tried to compete with him , they could not , and it was commonly recognized that Yuan Yong was the richest official at the time .

In 520 , Empress Dowager Hu 's brother-in-law , the general Yuan Cha , along with the eunuch Liu Teng ( ) and the palace attendant Hou Gang ( ) , carried out a coup against her , putting her under house arrest . Yuan Cha , however , was respectful of Yuan Yong , and he remained in a position of power , although Yuan Cha was effectively the regent . In 525 , Yuan Yong plotted with both Empress Dowager Hu and Emperor Xiaoming to restore Empress Dowager Hu , and later that year she seized power back from Yuan Cha and forced Yuan Cha to commit suicide . Yuan Yong , as one who participated in her plan , continued in his position of power . # Death # In 528 , with Empress Dowager Hu and Emperor Xiaoming in a conflict after Emperor Xiaoming wanted to put Empress Dowager Hu 's lover Zheng Yan ( ) to death by conspiring with the general Erzhu Rong , Empress Dowager Hu poisoned Emperor Xiaoming and put the young child Yuan Zhao , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throne . Erzhu refused to recognize Yuan Zhao 's imperial authority and advanced on Luoyang , quickly capturing it . He made Yuan Xie 's son Yuan Ziyou emperor ( as Emperor Xiaozhuang ) and threw Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao into the Yellow River to drown . Erzhu then believed that , in order to show his might , he needed to massacre the high level officials , whom the people viewed as corrupt . Under guise that they were needed to attend Emperor Xiaozhuang in sacrificing to heaven , he had them , led by Yuan Yong , report to Heyin , near Luoyang . Then , he had his cavalry surround them and massacre them . Erzhu would later regret this action , and he had Yuan Yong and the other officials killed buried with honor . # Notes # <references/>
