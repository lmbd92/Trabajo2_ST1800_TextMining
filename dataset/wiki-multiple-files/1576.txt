It was released on July 4 , 2007 as the first single from Misia 's eighth studio album ' ' Eighth World ' ' . # Background # Any Love is Misia 's first release since switching record labels , from Avex back to BMG Japan . The single was released simultaneously with The Tour of Misia 2007 Ascension concert DVD and Blu-ray . The first press edition of the single comes with a bonus DVD , which includes the music video for Any Love and a special film documenting Misia 's stay in Nairobi , Kenya , where the video and artwork for the single cover were shot . # Composition # The A-side , Any Love , was written by Misia , while the composition and production were handled by Sinkiroh . The song was inspired by Misia 's visit to the Kibera slum in Nairobi , Kenya . Coming from ' ' Ascension ' ' , which dealt with the broad themes of life and its origins , Misia wanted to write about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or everyday life . After writing lyrics that seemed too perfect and lacking a sense of reality , Misia felt at a loss and decided to take a trip to Africa , a place she had long wanted to visit . The culture and people left a deep impression on Misia which lead her to rewrite Any Love . In an interview with music site Vibe , she commented , ( the song ) was done before I left for Africa , but when I came back I realized there was more that I wanted to say , so I rewrote the lyrics and recorded it over again . In today 's society , it 's hard to discern between reality and truth and I wanted this song to reflect what I think makes them different . When asked about the importance of the line Honki de aishiteku , which is repeated throughout the choruses , Misia elaborated : # When I came back to Tokyo , I was taken aback by the contrast between the world I had been living in and the world I had just visited . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got back to my friends and family and music , I realized that love is what makes it all real . It 's what 's needed to distinguish reality from truth . The message of the song is that when facing love , you have to take it seriously . # The B-side , Soba ni Ite ... , was also written by Misia and composed and produced by Sinkiroh . When asked about the song 's message , Misia explained : # ( Soba ni Ite .. ) speaks of a message I 've wanted to express for a few years now . I think it 's great that , with the Internet , cell phones , and e-mail , there are now a variety of ways for us to communicate with each other , but they 've somewhat become substitutes for direct interactions . The reason people feel the need to be close to each other is because , as humans , we connect with more than just our eyes or our ears , but with our entire body . We can never be entirely sastified without meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials for Kose cosmetics Sekkisei , starring Nanako Matsushima. # Chart performance # Any Love debuted on the Oricon Daily Singles chart at number 8 on July 3 , 2007 and climbed to number 7 the following day .
