@@1213514 ERC is an Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) client integrated into GNU Emacs . It is written in Emacs Lisp. # Features # ERC includes message timestamping , automatic channel joining , flood control , and auto-completion of nicks and commands . ERC can highlight nicks and text for conversation tracking , highlight and optionally remove control characters , and allows URLs , nicknames and text to be converted to buttons . It provides input history , and separate buffers per server and channel . Notifications include channel activity on the EMacs mode-line , user online status , and channel tracking of hidden conversations . ERC is multi-lingual , and provides auto-script loading at startup . ERC has a modular design , with many features implemented in more than two dozen loadable modules included in the default setup , such as ' ' autoaway ' ' , ' ' fill ' ' ( splits long lines ) , ' ' log ' ' ( saves chat buffers ) , ' ' spelling ' ' , ' ' bbdb ' ' , which connects ERC to Emacs ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , which auto-replaces given text in messages . ERC supports SSL/TLS for encrypted IRC communication . # History # According to the GNU project , ERC was first developed by Alexander L. Belikoff and Sergey Berezin . Berezin wrote that ERC was originally written by Alexander L. Belikoff , then I improved it in many ways and promoted to version 2.0 . The pair stopped development in 1999 . Mario Lang wrote that as of 2001 ERC had been apparently abandoned , so he and Alexander Schroeder adopted it and created the ERC SourceForge project . Berezin responded positively to news of the renewed effort and bestowed stewardship to the new developers ; in the ensuing years , versions 2.1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 5.1 were released . ERC development moved from SourceForge to GNU in May 2006 , and ERC was officially incorporated into Emacs release 22.1 on June 3 , 2007 . ERC development now takes place inside the Emacs source-code tree . # Related work # ERC is one of two IRC clients included in the Emacs distribution ; rcirc is the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERC such as its ' ' activity tracker ' ' and others ; it was developed as ERC became difficult to debug and improve .
