@@28963514 The 201011 CONCACAF Champions League Championship Round was played from February to April 2011 . A total of eight teams qualified for the Championship Round from the Group Stage . The championship round draw was conducted on November 1 , 2010 , at the CONCACAF headquarters in New York City . In the quarterfinals , the group winners were assured of playing the second leg at home , and were drawn against the group runners-up , with the only restriction being that they could not face the same team that it played in the Group Stage ( and thus they may face a team from the same association ) . The championship round was played in knockout format . Each tie was played over two legs , and the away goals rule would be used , but not after a tie enters extra time , and so a tie would be decided by penalty shootout if the aggregate score is level after extra time . # Qualified teams # # Bracket # # Quarterfinals # The first legs of the Quarterfinals were played February 2224 , 2011 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
