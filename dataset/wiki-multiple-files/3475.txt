@@31998514 The transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy , known as ' ' Ennetbirgische Feldzge ' ' transmontane campaigns in Swiss historiography , were military expeditions which resulted in the conquest of territories south of the Alps , corresponding more or less to the modern canton of Ticino , on the part of the Old Swiss Confederacy . These territories were known as ' ' ennetbirgische Vogteien ' ' or transmontane bailiwicks . The Leventina was the first transalpine possession of the Swiss cantons of Uri and Obwalden , acquired in 1403 . Other territories were acquired in 1418 and 1419 . A first setback came with the Battle of Arbedo in 1422 , where the Swiss were defeated by the Duchy of Milan , and in a treaty of 1426 , the border of the duchy was moved back to the Gotthard Pass . Renewed campaigns took place in 1439 , 1441 and 1447 , until in 1449 the Swiss were beaten again by troops of the Golden Ambrosian Republic in the Battle of Castione . In 1466 , the duke of Milan promised to grant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on his promise , and as the Swiss were tied up in the Burgundian Wars he even formed a pact with the Burgundians . This prompted Uri to send an expedition to the Leventina , which was greeted as liberators by the local population . The Swiss tried to conquer Bellinzona as well , but after a two weeks ' siege gave up and returned home . The Battle of Giornico was for once a Swiss victory , in which a force of Uri of about 175 men , with the support of about 400 men from the local population , managed to rout a Milanese army of 10,000 . From this time , the Leventina was an undisputed possession of Uri , while Bellinzona remained under Milanese control . <BR> In 1487 , the Valais together with Lucerne wanted to expand into the Ossola . Besieging Domodossola and marauding the valleys , the Swiss were decisively defeated by the Ducal Milanese at the Battle of Crevola in April 1487 . This was the situation at the beginning of the Italian Wars in 1494 . Bellinzona was finally occupied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Louis XII of France in 1503 . The Battle of Novara ( 1513 ) was a success for the Swiss Confederacy and the allied Three Leagues which secured their possessions of Locarno , Lugano , Mendrisio , Cuvio , Travaglia , Chiavenna , Bormio , Tre pievi and Valtellina . The defeat in the Battle of Marignano ( 1515 ) set an end to Swiss aspirations to further extend their possessions , but the peace of 1516 allowed them to keep their possessions , except for Ossola which was handed back to Milan . These ' ' ennetbirgische Vogteien ' ' were governed partly by the entire confederacy , partly just by Uri , Schwyz and Nidwalden ( and the Leventina just by Uri ) throughout the early modern period . The Valtellina , governed by the Three Leagues from 1512 , was lost to Spain in the course of the ' ' Bndner Wirren ' ' , in 1639. # Transalpine bailiwicks # Overview of the transalpine bailiwicks ( , ) : Condominiums of the Forest cantons of Uri , Schwyz and Nidwalden : * Blenio 147780 and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1500 Condominiums of the Twelve Cantons ( ' ' Zwlf Orte ' ' , the Thirteen Cantons , minus Appenzell ) from 1512 : * Valmaggia * Lugano * Locarno * Mendrisio Condominiums of the Twelve Cantons from 1512 , but were lost from the Confederacy three years later and are now ' ' comuni ' ' of Lombardy and Piedmont : * Travaglia * Cuvio * Ossola ( ' ' Eschental ' ' )
