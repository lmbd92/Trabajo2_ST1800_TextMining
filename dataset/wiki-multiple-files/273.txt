@@780514 Spanish grammar is the grammar of the Spanish language ( ' ' espaol , castellano ' ' ) , which is a Romance language that originated in north central Spain and is spoken today throughout Spain , some twenty countries in the Americas , and Equatorial Guinea . Spanish is an inflected language . The verbs are potentially marked for tense , aspect , mood , person , and number ( resulting in some fifty conjugated forms per verb ) . The nouns form a two-gender system and are marked for number . Pronouns can be inflected for person , number , gender ( including a residual neuter ) , and case , although the Spanish pronominal system represents a simplification of the ancestral Latin system . Spanish was the first of the European vernaculars to have a grammar treatise , ' ' Gramtica de la lengua castellana ' ' , written in 1492 by the Andalusian linguist Antonio de Nebrija and presented to Isabella of Castile at Salamanca . The Real Academia Espaola ( RAE ) traditionally dictates the normative rules of the Spanish language , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Spanish are remarkably few , and someone who has learned the dialect of one area will have no difficulties using reasonably formal speech in the other ; however , pronunciation does vary , as well as grammar and vocabulary . Recently published comprehensive Spanish reference grammars in English include , , and . # Verbs # Every Spanish verb belongs to one of three form classes , characterized by the infinitive ending : ' ' -ar ' ' , ' ' -er ' ' , or ' ' -ir ' ' sometimes called the first , second , and third conjugations , respectively . A Spanish verb has nine indicative tenses with more-or-less direct English equivalents : the present tense ( ' I walk ' ) , the preterite ( ' I walked ' ) , the imperfect ( ' I was walking ' or ' I used to walk ' ) , the present perfect ( ' I have walked ' ) , the past perfect also called the pluperfect ( ' I had walked ' ) , the future ( ' I will walk ' ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conditional simple ( ' I would walk ' ) and the conditional perfect ( ' I would have walked ' ) . In most dialects , each verb tense has potentially six forms , varying for first , second , or third person and for singular or plural number . In the second person , Spanish maintains the so-called T-V distinction between familiar and formal modes of address . The formal second-person pronouns ( ' ' usted ' ' , ' ' ustedes ' ' ) take third-person verb forms . The second-person familiar plural is expressed in most of Spain with the pronoun ' ' vosotros ' ' and its characteristic verb forms ( e.g. ' ' comis ' ' ' you ( plural ) eat ' ) , while in Latin American Spanish that part of the paradigm is merged with the ' ' formal ' ' second-person plural ( e.g. ' ' ustedes comen ' ' ) . In other words , in Latin America , the familiar/formal distinction in the second person is not maintained in the plural . In many areas of Latin America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second-person familiar singular pronoun ' ' t ' ' is replaced by ' ' vos ' ' , which frequently requires its own characteristic verb forms , especially in the present indicative , where the endings are ' ' -s ' ' , ' ' -s ' ' , and ' ' -s ' ' for ' ' -ar ' ' , ' ' -er ' ' , ' ' -ir ' ' verbs , respectively . See voseo . In the tables of paradigms below , the ( optional ) subject pronouns appear in parentheses. # Present indicative # The present indicative is used to express actions or states of being in a present time frame . For example : * Yo ' ' soy ' ' alto ( I ' ' am ' ' tall ) . * Ella ' ' canta ' ' en el club ( She ' ' sings ' ' in the club ) . * Todos nosotros ' ' vivimos ' ' en un submarino amarillo ( We all ' ' live ' ' in a yellow submarine ) . * ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is ' ' ten thirty ) .

For example : * Yo era cmico en el pasado ( I was comical in the past ) * Usted coma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence is saying You used to eat a lot , saying that in the past , the person being referred had a characteristic of eating a lot ) * Ellos escuchaban la radio ( They were listening to the radio ) All three of the sentences above describe non-instantaneous actions that are viewed as continuing in the past .

For example : * Ellos escuchaban la radio cuando oyeron un ruido afuera . ( They were listening to the radio when they heard a noise outside. ) * Yo estaba en mi cuarto cuando usted entr . ( I was in my room when you came in. ) * Era un da muy tranquilo cuando eso pas . ( It was a very peaceful day when that happened . ) In all three cases , an event or completed action interrupts an ongoing state or action . For example , in the second sentence , the speaker states that he was in his room ( expressed through the imperfect to reflect the ongoing or unfinished state of being there ) when the other person interrupted that state by entering ( expressed through the preterite to suggest a completed action ) . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive both are used to express ongoing , progressive action in the present and past , respectively . For example : * Estoy haciendo mi tarea . ( I am doing my homework ) * Estamos estudiando . ( We are studying ) * Estaba escuchando la radio . ( I was listening to the radio ) * l estaba limpiando su cuarto . ( He was cleaning his room ) The present progressive is formed by first conjugating the verb estar or seguir , depending on context , to the subject , and then attaching a gerund of the verb that follows . The past ( imperfect ) progressive simply requires the estar or seguir to be conjugated , depending on context , in imperfect , with respect to the subject . # #Forming gerunds# # To form gerunds in an -ar verb , replace the -ar in the infinitive with -ando i.e. : jugar , hablar , caminar -- jugando , hablando , caminando For -er , or -ir verbs , replace the -er or -ir ending with -iendo i.e. : comer , escribir , dormir -- comiendo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem change , since it is an irregular verb . Verbs that end with two vowels and a consonant such as leer , traer , creer have a special exception : i.e. : leer , traer , creer -- leyendo , trayendo , creyendo Verbs that end with -eir , such as rer and sonrer have yet another exception i.e. : rer , frer -- riendo , friendo # Subjunctive # The subjunctive of a verb is used to express certain connotations in sentences such as a wish or desire , a demand , an emotion , uncertainty , or doubt . # #Present subjunctive# # Normally , a verb would be conjugated in the present indicative to indicate an event in the present frame of time . * Yo soy muy ambicioso ( I am very ambitious ) * Marta trae la comida ( Marta brings the food ) If the sentence is trying to express a desire , demand , or emotion , or something similar , in the present tense , the subjunctive is used . * Quiero que seas muy ambicioso ( I want you to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want ' ' that you be ' ' very ambitious * Me alegro de que Marta traiga la comida ( I am happy that Marta brings the food ) * Es una lstima que llegues tarde ( It is a shame that you arrive late ) The subjunctive is also used to convey doubt , denial , or uncertainty . * Busco un amigo que ' ' sea ' ' simptico ( I search for a friend who will ' ' be ' ' likable or I search for a likable friend ) * No hay ningn autor que lo ' ' escriba ' ' . ( There are no authors who ' ' write ' ' that. ) * Es posible que ella ' ' sepa ' ' mucho ( It is possible that she ' ' knows ' ' a lot. ) * No parece que ' ' tengan ' ' mucho dinero ( It does not seem that they ' ' have ' ' much money . ) In the first two examples , the ideally likable friend has not yet been found and remains an uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . In the third , possibility is not certainty , but rather a conjecture , and the last expresses clear doubt . Thus , subjunctive is used . Some of the phrases and verbs that require sentences to have subjunctive formation include : *Dudar , negar , esperar , alegrarse de , temer , sentir , pedir , aconsejar , exigir , desear , querer , mandar *Es necesario que , conviene que , no parece que , es dudoso que , es probable que , no creo que , importa que , parece mentira que Some phrases that require the indicative instead , because they express certainty , include : *Es verdad que , es obvio que , es seguro que , parece que , es evidente que , creo que To form the subjunctive , first take the present indicative first-person ( ' yo ' ) form of a verb . For example , the verbs hablar , comer , and escribir ( To talk , to eat , to write ) -- Yo hablo , yo como , yo escribo Then , replace the ending ' o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the following : If the verb is an -er or -ir verb such as comer , poder , escribir , or compartir , replace the ending o with an ' a ' i.e. : Yo como ; yo puedo ; yo escribo -- Yo coma ; yo pueda ; yo escriba If the verb is an -ar verb such as caminar , or hablar , replace the ending o with an ' e ' i.e. : Yo hablo ; yo camino -- Yo hable , yo camine This forms the first-person conjugation . The others are as follows : * Yo - Yo hable ; yo coma ; yo escriba * T - T hables ; t comas ; t escribas * l/Ella/Usted - l hable ; l coma ; l escriba * Nosotros - Nosotros hablemos ; nosotros comamos ; nosotros escribamos * Vosotros - Vosotros hablis ; vosotros comis ; vosotros escribis * Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes - ellos hablen ; ellos coman ; ellos escriban Since the ' ' vos ' ' forms are derived from ' ' vosotros ' ' the following would be expected ( and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vos coms ; vos escribs However , the Spanish Royal Academy , based in Argentinian usage recommends to use the same forms used for ' ' t ' ' : * Vos - Vos hables ; vos comas ; vos escribas # #Imperfect subjunctive# # Today , the two forms of the imperfect subjunctive are largely interchangeable. * The -se form derives ( as in most Romance languages ) from the Latin pluperfect subjunctive , while the -ra form derives from the Latin pluperfect indicative . The use of one or the other is largely a matter of personal taste and dialect . Many only use the ' ' -ra ' ' forms in speech , but vary between the two in writing . Many may spontaneously use either , or even prefer the rarer ' ' -se ' ' forms . The imperfect subjunctive is formed for basically the same reasons as the present subjunctive , but is used for other tenses and time frames . # Nouns # Spanish has nouns of two genders , masculine and feminine . # Adjectives # Spanish generally uses adjectives in a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are three key differences between English and Spanish adjectives. * In Spanish , adjectives usually go ' ' after ' ' the noun they modify . The exception is when the writer/speaker is being slightly emphatic , or even poetic , about a particular quality of an object ( rather than the mundane use of using the quality to specify which particular object they are referring to ) . ** ' ' Mi casa roja ' ' could either mean that there are many red houses in the world but I wish to talk about the one that I happen to own , or that I have many houses but am referring to the red one . ' ' Mi casa roja ' ' = My house , the red one . ** ' ' Mi roja casa ' ' means that I am stressing how red my particular house is ( probably the only house I have ) . ' ' Mi roja casa ' ' = My house , which is obviously red . * In Spanish , adjectives agree with what they refer to in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . For example , ' ' taza ' ' ( cup ) is feminine , so the red cup is ' ' la taza roj <u> a </u> ' ' , but ' ' vaso ' ' ( glass ) is masculine , so the red glass is ' ' el vaso roj <u> o </u> ' ' . * In Spanish , it is perfectly normal to let an adjective stand in for a noun or pronounwith ( where people are involved ) no implication of condescension or rudeness . For example , ' ' los altos ' ' means the tall ones or the tall men . ' ' El grande ' ' means the big one or the big man . # Determiners # Spanish uses determiners in a similar way to English . The main difference is that they agree with what they refer to in terms of both number ( singular/plural ) and gender ( masculine/feminine ) . # Articles # Definite articles : equivalent to the . Indefinite articles : equivalent to a/an , some . cellPadding=7 cellSpacing=0 border=1 !

BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB Femininelalasunaunas ! BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB Neuterlo The neuter article ' ' lo ' ' is used before a masculine singular adjective to form an expression equivalent to an abstract noun , e.g. ' ' lo interesante ' ' ' the interesting thing , the interesting part ' ( , 7.2.1 ; , 64 ) . ' ' Lo ' ' may also be used adverbially before an adjective that shows agreement with a noun , being equivalent to the relative adverb ' how ' , as in ' ' lo buenas que son ' ' ' how good they ( f.pl. ) are ' ( , 7.2.2 ; , 69 ) . When the article ' ' el ' ' follows either of the prepositions ' ' a ' ' or ' ' de ' ' , the sequence of two words forms a contraction , ' ' al ' ' ( ' to the ' ) or ' ' del ' ' ( ' of the , from the ' ) respectively . Examples : ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the park ' ) . ' ' l regresa del cine ' ' ( ' He returns from the movie theater ' ) . One never says ' ' a el ' ' or ' ' de el ' ' in Spanish . The feminine singular definite article ' ' la ' ' is replaced by ' ' el ' ' when directly before a noun that begins with a stressed a sound ( with or without silent ' ' h ' ' ) . Thus ' ' el agua ' ' , ' ' el hambre ' ' . The noun remains feminine , as shown by ' ' el agua fra ' ' . Likewise , the feminine indefinite article ' ' una ' ' is usually replaced by ' ' un ' ' in the same circumstances , thus ' ' un guila mexicana ' ' . When these words are in plural , the feminine articles are used . ' ' Example : ' ' el agua , las aguas. # Demonstratives # Spanish has three kinds of demonstrative , whose use depends on the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equates to the English terms this and that , although in Spanish the word used must agree for number and gender . cellPadding=7 cellSpacing=0 border=1 !

BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB Neuter singularestoesoaquello NOTE : When standing before the noun they qualify i.e. , when used as adjectives demonstratives never take an accent : esta casa ' ' ( this house ) ' ' , esos das ' ' ( those days ) ' ' . But demonstratives may also stand on their own , instead of the noun they refer to i.e. as demonstrative pronouns . In that case , they usually carry a written accent : Quiero ste ' ' ( I want this one ) ' ' . Neuter demonstratives have the meaning of this ( or that ) thing , concept or idea : Eso est bien ' ' ( That is okay ) ' ' . In certain cases , neuter demonstratives can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( Take that out of there ) ' ' . Neuter demonstratives , because of their use , are never used as adjectives , which makes it unnecessary for them ever to take an accent . Moreover , for their indefinite meaning they do not have plural forms . # Possessive # The possessive words agree in gender and number with the thing possessed . The possessive pronoun is formed by putting the agreeing definite article before the long form of the possessive adjective . Each cell in the table below shows the indicated adjective , followed by the corresponding pronoun . When the possessor is ' ' usted ' ' or ' ' ustedes ' ' , the third-person ( possessor ) form is used . cellPadding=7 cellSpacing=0 border=1 ! BGCOLOR= #DBDBDB POSSESSIVES !

Therefore , if a man has a house ( Spanish casa , which is a feminine noun ) we can say that La casa es suya ( The house is his ) , with a feminine possessive , according to the gender of the object this man possesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish , perro , a masculine noun ) , then we can say that El perro es suyo ( The dog is hers ) , with a masculine possessive to agree with the noun perro . # Other determiners # * Indefinite quantity : ' ' poco ' ' ( ' little ' ) , ' ' mucho ' ' ( ' a lot ' ) , ' ' bastante ' ' ( ' enough ' ) ... * Cardinals : ' ' un ' ' / ' ' una ' ' ( ' one ' ) , ' ' dos ' ' ( ' two ' ) , ' ' tres ' ' ( ' three ' ) ... * Ordinals : ' ' primero ' ' ( ' first ' ) , ' ' segundo ' ' ( ' second ' ) , ' ' tercero ' ' ( ' third ' ) ... Cardinal and ordinal numbers are adjectives of amount ( like ' ' mucho ' ' and ' ' poco ' ' ) and precede nouns ( ' ' dos animales ' ' = ' two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' first person ' ) . ' ' Primero ' ' and ' ' tercero ' ' drop their final ' ' -o ' ' before a masculine singular noun , thus ' ' el primer libro ' ' ( ' the first book ' ) , ' ' el tercer ao ' ' ( ' the third year ' ) . * Interrogative : ' ' qu ' ' ( ' what ' ) , ' ' cul ' ' ( ' which ' ) . The cardinal numbers greater than ' ' un ' ' / ' ' una ' ' and the interrogative ' ' qu ' ' are indeclinable . The indefinite quantifiers , ordinals , ' ' un ' ' , and ' ' cul ' ' are declined as adjectives. # Pronouns # Spanish has a range of pronouns that in some ways work quite differently from English ones . They include : ' ' yo , t , vos , usted , l , ella , ello , nosotros , vosotros , ustedes , ellos , ellas , esto , eso , aquello ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , but it is not rare to see one in written text or in the spoken language , whether it be for emphasis or in cases where there may be some confusion between conjugations. # Prepositions # Spanish has a relatively large number of prepositions , and does not use postpositions . The following list is traditionally recited : ' ' A , ante , bajo , cabe , con , contra , de , desde , en , entre , hacia , hasta , para , por , segn , sin , so , sobre , tras . ' ' Lately , two new prepositions have been added : durante and mediante , usually placed at the end to preserve the list ( which is usually learnt by heart by Spanish students ) . This list includes two archaic prepositions ( ' ' so ' ' and ' ' cabe ' ' ) , but leaves out two new Latinisms ( ' ' va ' ' and ' ' pro ' ' ) as well as a large number of very important compound prepositions . Prepositions in Spanish do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . For example , to translate run out of water run up a bill run down a pedestrian run in a thief into Spanish requires completely different verbs , and not simply the use of correr ( run ) plus the corresponding Spanish prepositions . This is more due to the nature of English phrasal verbs rather than an inherent function of Spanish verbs or prepositions . # Conjunctions # The Spanish conjunctions ' ' y ' ' ( ' and ' ) and ' ' o ' ' ( ' or ' ) alter their form in both spoken and written language to ' ' e ' ' and ' ' u ' ' respectively when followed by an identical vowel sound . Thus , ' ' padre e hijo ' ' ( ' father and son ' ) , ' ' Fernando e Isabel ' ' ( ' Ferdinand and Isabella ' ) , ' ' sujeto u objeto ' ' ( ' subject or object ' ) , ' ' vertical u horizontal ' ' ( ' vertical or horizontal ' ) . The change does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' of a diphthong , as in ' ' acero y hierro ' ' ( ' steel and iron ' ) . Nor does the conjunction ' ' y ' ' change when initial in a question ( where it serves to introduce or reintroduce a name as a topic , rather than to link one element with another ) , as in ' ' Y Ins ? ' ' ( ' What about Ins ? ' ) . When the conjunction ' ' o ' ' appears between numerals , it is usually spelled with an accent mark ( ' ' ' ' ) , in order to distinguish it from zero ( ' ' 0 ' ' ) ; thus , ' ' 2 3 ' ' ( ' 2 or 3 ' ) in contrast to ' ' 203 ' ' ( ' two-hundred three ' ) . # Syntactic variation # # Cleft sentences # A cleft sentence is one formed with the copular verb ( generally with a dummy pronoun like it as its subject ) , plus a word that cleaves the sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put emphasis on a part of the sentence . Here are some examples of English sentences and their cleft versions : * I did it . It was I who did it . or colloquially It was me that did it . * You will stop smoking through willpower . It is through willpower that you will stop smoking . Spanish does not usually employ such a structure in simple sentences . The translations of sentences like these can be readily analyzed as being normal sentences containing relative pronouns . Spanish is capable of expressing such concepts without a special cleft structure thanks to its flexible word order . For example , if we translate a cleft sentence such as It was Juan who lost the keys , we get ' ' Fue Juan el que perdi las llaves . ' ' Whereas the English sentence uses a special structure , the Spanish one does not . The verb ' ' fue ' ' has no dummy subject , and the pronoun ' ' el que ' ' is not a cleaver but a nominalising relative pronoun meaning the male one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and las llaves , we can play with the word order of the Spanish sentence without affecting its structure although each permutation would , to a native speaker , give a subtly different shading of emphasis . For example , we can say ' ' Juan fue el que perdi las llaves ' ' ( Juan was the one who lost the keys ) or ' ' El que perdi las llaves fue Juan ' ' ( The one who lost the keys was Juan ) . As can be seen from the translations , if this word order is chosen , English stops using the cleft structure ( there is no more dummy it and a nominalising relative is used instead of the cleaving word ) whilst in Spanish no words have changed . Here are some examples of such sentences : * ' ' Fue Juan <u> el que </u> perdi las llaves. ' ' = It was John who lost the keys . * ' ' Son slo tres das <u> los que </u> te quedan. ' ' = It is only three days that you have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lo diga. ' ' = It will be I who tells him . * ' ' Son pocos <u> los que </u> vienen y se quedan. ' ' = lit . It is not many who come and stay . Note that it is ungrammatical to try to use just ' ' que ' ' to cleave such sentences as in English , but using ' ' quien ' ' in singular or ' ' quienes ' ' in plural is grammatical . * ' ' *Fue Juan <u> que </u> perdi las llaves. ' ' ( incorrect ) * ' ' Fue Juan <u> quien </u> perdi las llaves. ' ' ( correct ) When prepositions come into play , things become complicated . Structures unambiguously identifiable as cleft sentences are used . The verb ' ' ser ' ' introduces the stressed element and then there is a nominaliser . Both of these are preceded by the relevant preposition . For example : * ' ' Fue <u> a m a quien </u> le dio permiso. ' ' = It was me to whom he gave permission , lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * ' ' Es <u> para nosotros para quienes </u> se hizo esto . ' ' = It is us for whom this was made , lit . It is for us for whom this was made * ' ' Es <u> por eso por lo que </u> lo hice. ' ' = That is why I did it , more literally : It is because of that that I did it , or completely literally : It is because of that because of which I did it . * ' ' Es as <u> como </u> se debe hacer ' ' = It is this way that it must be done , lit . It is this way how it must be done ( ' ' como ' ' replaces longer expressions such as ' ' la forma en que ' ' ) This structure is quite wordy , and is therefore often avoided by not using a cleft sentence at all . Emphasis is conveyed just by word order and stressing with the voice ( indicated here within bolding ) : * ' ' Me dio permiso <u> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me * ' ' Se hizo esto <u> para nosotros </u> . ' ' = This was done for us * ' ' <u> Por eso </u> lo hice. ' ' = I did it because of that * ' ' Se debe hacer <u> as </u> ' ' = It must be done this way In casual speech , the complex cleaving pronoun is often reduced to ' ' que ' ' , just as it is reduced to that in English . Foreign learners are advised to avoid this . * ' ' Es para nosotros <u> que </u> se hizo esto . ' ' * ' ' Es por eso <u> que </u> lo hice. ' ' * ' ' Fue a m <u> que </u> le dio permiso. ' ' ( preferred : ' ' a quien ' ' ) * ' ' Es as <u> que </u> se debe hacer ' ' ( preferred : ' ' como ' ' ) In the singular , the subordinate clause can agree either with the relative pronoun or with the subject of the main sentence , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plural , only agreement with the subject of the main sentence is acceptable . Therefore : ; Singular * ' ' Yo fui el que <u> me lo beb </u> ' ' = I was the one who drank it ( agreement with subject of main sentence ) * ' ' Yo fui el que <u> se lo bebi </u> ' ' ( preferred form with same meaning , agreement with ' ' el que ' ' ) * ' ' La que lo <u> s </u> soy yo ' ' = I am the one who knows ( agreement with subject of main sentence ) * ' ' La que lo <u> sabe </u> soy yo ' ' = ( preferred form with same meaning , agreement with ' ' la que ' ' ) ; Plural * ' ' Somos los nicos que no <u> tenemos </u> ni un centavo para apostar ' ' = We are the only ones who do not have even a cent to bet ( agreement with subject of main sentence ) ( from dialogue of the Gabriel Garca Mrquez novel ' ' El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ' ' Vosotras sois las que lo <u> sabis </u> ' ' = You girls are the ones who know ( agreement with subject of main sentence ) # Dialectal variations # # Forms of address # The use of ' ' usted ' ' and ' ' ustedes ' ' as a polite form of address is universal . However , there are variations in informal address . ' ' Ustedes ' ' replaces ' ' vosotros ' ' in much of Andalusia , the Canary Islands and Latin America , except in the liturgical or poetic of styles . In some parts of Andalusia , the pronoun ' ' ustedes ' ' is used with the standard ' ' vosotros ' ' endings . Depending on the region , Latin Americans may also replace the singular ' ' t ' ' with ' ' usted ' ' or ' ' vos ' ' . The choice of pronoun is a tricky issue and can even vary from village to village . Travellers are often advised to play it safe and call everyone ' ' usted ' ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other areas where syllable-final /s/ is completely silent is that there is no audible difference between the second and third person singular form of the verb . This leads to redundant pronoun use , for example , the tagging on of ' ' t ves ? ' ' ( pronounced ' ' tuv ' ' ) to the ends of sentences , where other speakers would say ' ' ves ? ' ' . # # ' ' Voseo ' ' # # ' ' Vos ' ' was used in medieval Castilian as a polite form , like the French ' ' vous ' ' and the Italian ' ' voi ' ' , and it used the same forms as ' ' vosotros ' ' . This gave three levels of formality : * ' ' T quieres ' ' * ' ' Vos queris ' ' ( originally ' ' queredes ' ' ) * ' ' Vuestra merced quiere ' ' ( today ' ' usted ' ' ) Whereas ' ' vos ' ' was lost in standard Spanish , some dialects lost ' ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as the informal pronoun . The exact connotations of this practice , called ' ' voseo ' ' , depend on the dialect . In certain countries there may be socioeconomic implications . El ' ' voseo ' ' uses the pronoun ' ' vos ' ' for ' ' t ' ' , but maintains ' ' te ' ' as an object pronoun and ' ' tu ' ' and ' ' tuyo ' ' as possessives . In ' ' voseo ' ' , verbs corresponding to ' ' vos ' ' in the present indicative ( roughly equivalent to the English simple present ) , are formed from the second person plural ( the form for ' ' vosotros ' ' ) . If the second person plural ends in is or is , the form for ' ' vos ' ' drops the i : * Vosotros hablis - vos habls. * Vosotros tenis - vos tens . Similarly the verb ser ( to be ) has : * Vosotros sois - vos sos . If the second person plural ends in -s ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' vos ' ' is identical : * Vosotros vivs - vos vivs. * Vosotros os - vos os. * Vosotros hus - vos hus . In the imperative , the form for ' ' vos ' ' is also derived from the second person plural . The latter ends always in -d . So for the form for ' ' vos ' ' this d is removed , and if the verb has more than one syllable , an accent is added to the last vowel : * Tened ( vosotros ) - ten ( vos ) * Dad ( vosotros ) - da ( vos ) . The only exception to these rules is in the verb ir ( to go ) , which does not have an imperative form for vos and uses the analogous form of the verb andar , which has a similar meaning , and is regular : * Andad - and . In the present subjunctive , the same rules as for the present indicative apply , though these forms coexist in Argentina with those for the pronoun t : * Que vosotros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digas - que vos digas . Other tenses always have the same form for vos as for t . Outside Argentina , other combinations are possible . For instance , people in Maracaibo may use standard ' ' vosotros ' ' endings for ' ' vos ' ' ' ' ( vos hablis , que vos hablis ) ' ' . # # ' ' Vosotros ' ' imperative : ' ' -ar ' ' for ' ' -ad ' ' # # In Spain , colloquially , the infinitive is used instead of the normative imperative for ' ' vosotros ' ' . This is not accepted in the normative language . * ' ' Venir ! ' ' instead of ' ' Venid ! ' ' * ' ' Callaros ! ' ' instead of ' ' Callaos ! ' ' ( ' ' Callarse ! ' ' in some dialects ) * ' ' Iros ! ' ' or ' ' Marcharos ! ' ' instead of ' ' Idos ! ' ' # # non-normative ' ' -s ' ' on ' ' t ' ' form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normatively has an ' ' -s ' ' ending in the second person singular of the preterite or simple past . For example , ' ' lo hicistes ' ' instead of the normative ' ' lo hiciste ' ' ; ' ' hablastes t ' ' for ' ' hablaste t ' ' . This is the only instance in which the ' ' t ' ' form does not end in an ' ' -s ' ' in the normative language . Ladino has gone further with ' ' hablates ' ' . # Third-person object pronoun variation # The third-person direct- and indirect-object pronouns exhibit variation from region to region , from one individual to another , and even within the language of single individuals . The Real Academia Espaola prefers an etymological usage , namely one in which the indirect object function is carried by ' ' le ' ' ( regardless of gender ) , and the direct object function is carried by ' ' la ' ' or ' ' lo ' ' ( according to the gender of the antecedent , and regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' ' le ' ' as a direct object form for masculine , animate antecedents ( i.e. male humans ) . Deviations from these approved usages are named ' ' lesmo ' ' ( for the use of ' ' le ' ' as a direct object ) , and ' ' lasmo ' ' and ' ' losmo ' ' ( for the use of ' ' la ' ' and ' ' lo ' ' as indirect objects ) . Each of these usages is further described in its own Wikipedia article . This object pronoun variation is studied in detail by . # ' ' Quesmo ' ' and ' ' dequesmo ' ' # Noun clauses in Spanish are typically introduced by the complementizer ' ' que ' ' , and such a noun clause may serve as the object of the preposition ' ' de ' ' , resulting in the sequence ' ' de que ' ' in the standard language . This sequence , in turn , is often reduced colloquially to just ' ' que ' ' , and this reduction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of hypercorrection ( i.e. in an apparent effort to avoid the error of ' ' quesmo ' ' ) , insert ' ' de ' ' before ' ' que ' ' in contexts where it is not prescribed in the standard grammar . This insertion of extraneous ' ' de ' ' before ' ' que ' ' called ' ' dequesmo ' ' is generally associated with less-educated speakers .
