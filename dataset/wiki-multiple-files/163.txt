In a 13-year professional career , he peaked in 1987 , becoming the second of only two cyclists to win the Triple Crown of victories in the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia stage races , plus the World road race championship . Roche 's rise coincided with that of fellow Irishman Sean Kelly . Although one of the finest cyclists of his generation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries and never contended in the Grand Tours post-1987 . He had 58 professional career wins . All of these wins still stand , despite Roche having been accused by an Italian judge of taking EPO in the later part of his career . # Early life and amateur career # On completion of his apprenticeship as a machinist in a Dublin dairy and following a successful amateur career in Ireland with the Orwell Wheelers club coached by Noel O'Neill of Dundrum ( which included winning the Irish Junior Championship in 1977 and the Rs Tailteann in 1979 where he became the youngest rider ever to win the Rs ) , Roche joined the Athletic Club de Boulogne-Billancourt amateur team in Paris to prepare for the 1980 Olympic games in Moscow . Soon after his arrival Roche won the amateur ParisRoubaix , escaping with Dirk Demol and sprinting to victory on the track at Roubaix . Roche was told by his directeur sportif that if he did not win he would be sent home to Ireland that day . He also finished on the podium at the early-season Paris Ezy road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race which was won by Bob Downs . However , a knee injury caused by a poorly fitted shoe plate led to a disappointing ride in Moscow , where he finished 45th . However , on return to France , August to October saw Roche win 19 races . That led to a contract with the Peugeot professional cycling team for 1981. # Professional career # Roche scored his first professional victory by beating Bernard Hinault in the Tour of Corsica . Less than a month later he won ParisNice ( where he became the first , and still the only , new pro to win Paris-Nice ) despite illness following the descent from Mont Ventoux and finished his debut season with victories in the Tour de Corse , Circuit d'Indre-et-Loire and Etoile des Espoirs races with a second place behind Hinault in the Grand Prix des Nations . In total , his debut yielded 10 victories . In 1982 his best performance was second in the Amstel Gold Race behind Jan Raas , but his rise continued in 1983 with victories in the Tour de Romandie , Grand Prix de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1983 Tour de France , Roche finished 13th and he finished the 1983 season with a bronze medal in the world cycling championship at Alterheim in Zurich . In 1984 , riding for La Redoute following contractual wrangles with Peugeot ( the settlement of which led Roche to sport Peugeot shorts for two years before winning a court action against Vlo Club de Paris Peugeot ) he repeated his Tour de Romandie win , won Nice-Alassio , Subida a Arrate and was second in ParisNice . He finished 25th in that year 's Tour de France . In 1985 , Roche won the Critrium International , the Tour de Midi-Pyrnes and came second in ParisNice and third in LigeBastogneLige . In the 1985 Tour de France Roche won stage 18 to the Aubisque and finished on the podium in 3rd position , 4 minutes and 29 seconds behind winner Bernard Hinault. # Chronic knee injury # In 1986 at a six-day event with UK professional Tony Doyle at Paris-Bercy , Roche crashed at speed and damaged his right knee . This destroyed his 1986 season at new team with little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roche finished the 1986 Tour de France 48th , 1h 32m behind Greg LeMond , a Tour that Roche described as like entering a dark tunnel of pain . The injury and then associated back problems recurred throughout his career ( for example in the 1989 Tour Roche retired after banging the problem knee on his handlebars ) and a series of operations appeared to only address direct or consequential symptoms of the core injury . Later non-surgical intervention under Dr.Hans-Wilhelm Mller-Wohlfahrt in Munich made some difference but the injury required constant care . By the end of his career Roche was unable to compete at his best because of back problem which led to a loss of power in the left leg . In retirement he described riding the 1993 Tour de France just for fun . He finished 13th , riding for Claudio Chiappucci ) . # 1987 Triple Crown # In 1987 , Roche had a tremendous season . In the spring , he won the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana , taking a third victory in the Tour de Romandie and fourth place plus a stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the closest he got to winning a professional ' Monument ' Classic . He blamed it on tactical naivet and riding like an amateur . In the Giro d'Italia , Roche took three stage wins ( including a team win with in the team time trial ) en route to overall victory and became the first Giro victor from outside mainland Europe . Roche 's stage wins that year in the Giro were stage 1b , the 8 km time trial downhill on the Poggio into San Remo and stage 22 , a 32 km individual time trial into St. Vincent . Despite his stage wins , the race is remembered for the stage from Lido di Jesolo to Sappada , where Roche , contravening team orders , broke away alone early and despite being caught late in the race , had the strength to go with the counterattack and take the pink jersey from his team-mate Roberto Visentini , who had been previously leading the classification . His behaviour in the stage gained him the tifosi 's hatred . It was said the only member of his team that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his domestique Eddy Schepers , although Roche recruited Panasonic riders and old ACBB team-mates Robert Millar and Australian Phil Anderson to protect him with Schepers on the Marmolada climb ( a day known as the Marmolada Massacre ) . Roche finished the Giro exhausted but favourite for the Tour de France . Following Bernard Hinault 's retirement , Laurent Fignon 's choppy form and with Greg LeMond injured following an accidental shooting while hunting , the 1987 Tour was open . It was also one of the most mountainous since the war , with 25 stages . Roche won the 87.5 km individual time trial stage 10 to Futuroscope and came second on stage 19 . On the next stage , crossing the Galibier and Madeleine and finishing at La Plagne , Roche attacked early , was away for several hours but was caught on the last climb . His nearest rival Pedro Delgado then attacked . Despite being almost 1 and a half minutes in arrears midway up the last climb , Roche pulled the deficit back to 4 seconds . Roche collapsed and lost consciousness and was given oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied Oui , mais pas de femme toute de suite ( yes , but I am not ready for a woman straight away ) . The yellow jersey changed hands several times with Charly Mottet , Roche , Jean Franois Bernard and Delgado all wearing it before Roche used the final 35 km time trial to overturn a half-minute gap and win the Tour by 40 seconds , which was at the time the second narrowest margin ( in 1968 Jan Janssen had beaten Herman van Springel by 38 seconds ; two years after Roche 's victory , Greg LeMond beat Laurent Fignon by 8 seconds ) . Roche became only the fifth cyclist in history to win the Tour and the Giro in the same year . He was also the only Irishman to win the Tour de France . Irish Taoiseach Charles Haughey joined Roche on the podium on the Champs-lyses . Later that year , with victory at the World road race championship in Villach in Austria , Roche became only the second to win the Triple Crown of Cycling . Roche arrived with insufficient training although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his team-mate Sean Kelly and escaped in the race winning break only while covering for his countryman . With Moreno Argentin in the following group , Kelly did not chase and as the break slowed and jostling for position began for a sprint , Roche attacked 500 m from the finish and crossed the line with metres to spare . Victory in the season-long ' ' Super Prestige Pernod International ' ' competition was assured . Roche was given the freedom of Dublin in late September 1987 . Several days later the 1987 edition of the Nissan Classic began and Roche rode strongly to finish second behind Kelly . # Post-1987 career # At the close of 1987 , Roche moved to Fagor MBK , bringing English riders Sean Yates and Malcolm Elliot , 1984 Tour de France King of the Mountains winner Robert Millar and domestique Eddy Schepers . The team was criticised for containing too many English speakers . The 1988 season began badly with a recurrence of the knee injury and Roche began a gradual decline . In 1989 he again took second in ParisNice ( making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roche finished the 1989 Giro d'Italia ninth behind Laurent Fignon . During the 1989 Tour de France , Roche withdrew due to his knee . There were problems with his team in and he changed again . In 1990 , racing for Histor Sigma , he won the Four Days of Dunkirk and 1991 riding for Roger De Vlaeminck 's TonTon Tapis brought victories in the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme and Critrium International . In the 1991 Tour de France , Roche missed the start for his team 's Team time trial and was forced to withdraw due to controversially missing the time cut . In the Grand Tours , he was ninth in the 1989 Giro , and won a stage of the 1992 Tour de France in appalling conditions into La Bourboule ( again racing for but now in support of Claudio Chiappucci ) and en route to a final ninth place .

His book ' ' Rough Ride ' ' exposed drug use apparently endemic in the peloton but spoke in fawning terms about Roche . Publication resulted in a threat of litigation from Roche . It was reported in the Rome newspaper , La Repubblica , in January 2000 that Francesco Conconi , a professor at the University of Ferrara involved with administering erythropoietin ( EPO ) to riders on the Carrera team with which Roche had some of his best years , had provided riders including Roche with EPO . Roche denied the allegations . This was further reported in the Irish Times several days later , Roche again denying EPO . In March 2000 the Italian judge Franca Oliva published a report detailing the investigation into sports doctors including Conconi . This official judicial investigation unequivocally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year in the peloton .
