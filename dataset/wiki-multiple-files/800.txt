@@3703514 Claude Beat Fehr ( 21 June 1943 18 June 1967 ) was a racing driver from Switzerland , born in Zurich . He started racing in 1963 , and raced several marques , including Alfa Romeo , Cooper , and De Tomaso , before buying a Brabham from fellow driver Jrg Dubler . Fehr was killed in an Italian Formula Three race at Caserta , the XVIII Coppa d'Oro Pasquale Amato , the same race that claimed the lives of Geki Russo and Tiger Perdomi . Fehr collided with the similar Brabham of Andrea Saltari and although neither driver was hurt , Fehr 's car was left blocking the track . The next driver , Franco Foresti , skidded on oil from the accident and crashed , prompting Fehr to get out of his car and run down the track to warn oncoming drivers . The next car along was the Matra of Geki Russo , who crashed into the wrecked cars lying on the track , before striking a concrete wall . Russo was thrown out of his car and died immediately . The exact details are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by one of the next group of drivers to arrive at the scene . Corrado Manfredini , Tiger Perdomi , Massimo Natili , Manfred Mohr and Jrg Dubler , among others , all crashed at the same point . Perdomi was trapped in his car for some time before rescue teams arrived , and he was eventually extricated by his own pit crew . He died in hospital eight days later . Fehr was posthumously awarded with a Letter of Congratulations from the International Fairplay Committee for his actions .
