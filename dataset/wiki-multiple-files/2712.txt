@@23681514 The Magazine cover indicator is a somewhat irreverent economic indicator , though sometimes taken seriously by technical analysts , which says that the cover story on the major business magazines , particularly ' ' BusinessWeek ' ' , ' ' Forbes ' ' and ' ' Fortune ' ' in the United States is often a contrary indicator . A famous example is a 1979 cover of ' ' BusinessWeek ' ' titled The Death of Equities . The ' 70s had been a generally bad decade for the stock market and at the time the article was written the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 800 . However , 1979 roughly marked a turning point , and stocks went on to enjoy a bull market for the better part of two decades . Even after the financial crisis of 20072010 , stocks remain far above their 1979 levels . Using the Magazine Cover Indicator , ' ' Business Week s projection that equities were dead should have been a buy signal . By the time an idea has had time to make its way to the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has likely run its course . Similarly , good news on a cover can be taken as an ill omen . As Paul Krugman has joked Whom the Gods would destroy , they first put on the cover of ' ' Business Week ' ' . Although there are a number of examples where magazines have been wrong , even spectacularly wrong , there is a tendency to ignore all the times the covers are right . In January 2008 , for example , ' ' Business Week ' ' ran a cover story entitled Meltdown ; For Housing the Worst Is Yet To Come and in July 2008 a cover story called The Home Price Abyss ; Why the threat of a free fall is growing and indeed , for the rest of 2008 and into 2009 home prices continued to plummet . An investor who interpreted the magazine covers as a contrary indicator and purchased real estate would have lost much of his investment . # References #
