Around 1036 , a Viking force , known as Varangians or Varyags , unexpectedly appeared near the village of Bashi on the Rioni River in western Georgia . The old Georgian chronicle Kartlis Tskhovreba described them as 3,000 men who had traveled from Scandinavia through Russia , rowing down the Dniepr River and across the Black Sea . King Bagrat IV welcomed them to Georgia and accepted some of them into the Georgian army ; several hundred Vikings fought on Bagrats side at the Battle of Sasireti in 1046 . Other Vikings continued westward , thereafter disappearing from history . Swedish researchers recently suggested that the story in the Georgian chronicle was about the Swedish expedition by the Viking chieftain Ingvar den Vittfarne ( Ingvar the Far-Traveled ) , which features in many rune stones in mid-Sweden. # Bibliography # * Alexander Mikaberidze Historical Dictionary of Georgia , Historical Dictionaries of Europe , No. 50 ( The Scarecrow Press , Inc.Lanham , Maryland Toronto Plymouth @ @ @ @
