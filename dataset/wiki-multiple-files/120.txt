@@228514 ' ' Acrobates ' ' ' ' Distoechurus ' ' The Acrobatidae are a small family of gliding marsupials containing two genera , each with a single species , the feathertail glider ( ' ' Acrobates pygmaeus ' ' ) from Australia and feather-tailed possum ( ' ' Distoechurus pennatus ' ' ) from New Guinea . This family of the Diprotodontia order , which can be found in the east coast and inland of Australia and in some islands of New Guinea , is characterized by their very small size , which has side effects : because their mass-to-surface-area ratio is so small , heat escapes quicker from their bodies than it would in larger animals ( the larger the mass-to-surface-area ratio , the harder it is to get rid of heat ) . Therefore , when temperature drops or food is scarce , they have trouble maintaining their body temperature and they enter a state known as torpidity ( not to be confused with hibernation , which is not known in marsupials ) which can last between one day and two weeks . In this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops to almost that of its surroundings , and the animal becomes unresponsive . # Taxonomy # * Family Acrobatidae ** Genus ' ' Acrobates ' ' *** Feathertail glider , ' ' Acrobates pygmaeus ' ' ** Genus ' ' Distoechurus ' ' *** Feather-tailed possum , ' ' Distoechurus pennatus ' '
