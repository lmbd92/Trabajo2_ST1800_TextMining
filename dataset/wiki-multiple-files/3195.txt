According to the UNT Composition Department , the award for Dr. Thomson was particularly deserved because he is continuing a broad ( interdisciplinary ) and prolific career in music that spans beyond that of a composer . # Military service # Thomas served as a Seaman ( S2c ; Service No. 358 74 10 ) in the U.S. Navy from 1945 to 1946 . He was a musician in a Navy Band at Camp Elliott , California . Then he joined the Navy Band ( as jazz trumpet soloist ) aboard the USS Lexington ( CV-16 ) as it sailed from San Diego to Pearl Harbor . While at Camp Elliott , Thomson did freelance arranging for Gus Arnheim , who , in the 1940s , owned a nightclub in downtown San Diego where he kept a small band going . Thomson was not permitted to enter the club during performances ( he was too young ) ; but he listened to the band playing his arrangements over the radio . Arnheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # In his younger days , Thomson learned to play french horn and trumpet , both in the classical and jazz idioms . When Thomson was five , his father bought him a cornet , hoping to stave off his interest in the piano that his sister was studying ( boys did n't play piano ) . And from that age , Thomson 's mother began driving him to TCU on Saturdays for lessons with Don Gillis . When Thomson was eight , Don recommended that -- since the highest paid member of any symphony in this country ( after the concert master ) , was the principal French horn player -- perhaps he should switch to horn . So he did . The Gillis family lived in Polytechnic Heights , about four blocks from the Thomson family . The Gillis family attended Poly Baptist church , where the Thomson family were members . Don Gillis was very much involved in music at TCU . Growing up , Thomson played French horn in Poly Baptist Church orchestra , directed by Don Gillis . Don 's sister , Eileen , played piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn . A member of the Crystal Springs Ramblers , Kenneth Pitts , played violin . Thomson read the baritone part from the Broadman Hymnal , transposing it for horn . Thomson attended Polytechnic High School , where he was involved in the band . Thomson became proficient at playing jazz solos on French horn with the Poly High School band . His high school band director was Perry Alton Sandifer ( 19102009 ) , a trombonist , saxophonist , and clarinetist who , outside of school , performed in dance orchestras -- one led by him bearing his name . Thomson graduated from Polytechnic High School in 1943. # Family # William Ennis Thomson ( aka Billy , while growing up ) was born 1927 in Fort Worth to the marriage of William Tell Thomson ( a builder ) and Ruby F. Thomson ( ' ' ' ' Schwarz ; a homemaker ) . He had two siblings : Jack C. Thomson ( b. 1912 ) and Aline Thomson ( born 1918 ) . William Ennis Thomson married Elizabeth Anne Everett , September 11 , 1948 , together , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurie Elizabeth , and John Everett .
