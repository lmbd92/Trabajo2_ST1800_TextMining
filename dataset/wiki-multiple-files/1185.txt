FIBA invited four wild card teams to fill out the twenty-four team field . # Wild cards # The four wild cards were determined by FIBA through criteria . For example , a team must have played in the Zone 's qualification tournament to receive recommendation .

Both Greek coach Jonas Kazlauskas and Serbian coach Duan Ivkovi criticized FIBA for waiting until less than 48 hours before the tournament over a week after the brawl to announce the suspensions , citing the unfairness of playing shorthanded for the first games . Greece eventually won their first two games in spite of the suspensions , while Serbia won two of their first three games . # Bamberg Super Cup # # Preliminary round # The top four finishers in each of the four preliminary round groups advanced to the sixteen team , single-elimination knockout stage , where Group A teams would meet Group B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved the most successful in the first round , as nine of the ten teams advanced to the knockout stage ( only Germany did not progress ) .
