Born in Khunwana during the ' ' difaqane ' ' period , Molema was the son of Kgosi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close confidant , Montshiwa , later became chief . During the period that the Tshidi Barolong resided at Thaba Nchu , where they found refuge during the difaqane , Molema was converted to Christianity by the Wesleyan missionaries based there . Molema 's son and heir , Silas Molema , was educated at Healdtown College . ( Silas helped his nephew Sebopioa Molema get to the United States about 1904 to study law at Wilberforce University in Wilberforce , Ohio . ) In 1857 Molema led an advance guard to scout out the area along the Molopo River . This was a familiar area as they had previously lived in nearby Khunwana . Molema settled at Mafikeng ( known in its early years as Molemas town ) , while the main body of the Barolong under Montshiwa followed . But Montshiwa did not feel safe at Mafikeng due to the close presence and encroachment of the Boers in the Transvaal . He led his followers to Moshaneng in the territory of the Bangwaketse in present-day Botswana . Molema remained at Mafikeng to ensure that the Barolong retained a presence there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites in the proximity of the Molopo . Molema had to use all his diplomatic skills on several occasions to prevent Boer incursion and settlement near Mafikeng . He has been described as a man of strong personality and exceptional gifts ... and Montshiwa 's chief counsellor in vital matters . ( S.M Molema:35 ) After negotiations with Molema , Montshiwa decided to return to Mafikeng in 1876 . Molema was a firm believer in Western education , having attended Healdtown ; he opened a school for the Barolong once they had settled in the district . Molema became a farmer and businessman , as well as advising his brother Montshiwa . He died in 1882 . One of his sons , Silas Molema , became a Doctor and historian of the Barolong. ( see S.M. Molema ) . The settlement was named Mafikeng , a ' ' Setswana ' ' name meaning place of stones . Later British settlers spelled the name as Mafeking .

The Siege of Mafeking lasted 217 days from October 1899 to May 1900 , and turned Robert Baden-Powell into a national hero .

In all , 212 people were killed during the siege , with more than 600 wounded . Boer losses were significantly higher . Although it was outside the protectorate 's borders , Mafeking served as capital of the Bechuanaland Protectorate from 1894 until 1965 , when Gaborone was made the capital of what was to become Botswana . Mafeking also briefly served as capital of the pre-independence Bantustan of Bophuthatswana in the 1970s , before the adjoining town of Mmabatho was established as capital . Following a local referendum on the issue , Mafeking joined Bophuthatswana in 1980 , three years after Bophuthatswana was awarded independence , and was renamed ' ' Mafikeng ' ' , and treated as a suburb of Mmabatho . Following the end of apartheid in 1994 , the merged Mafikeng and Mmabatho was instated as capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Facilities # North-West University Mafikeng Train Station Mmabatho Stadium Mafikeng Airport Mafikeng Game Reserve(4800Ha) Botsalano Game Reserve(5800Ha) Molemane Eye Nature Reserve # Name # The town 's name was first spelt by British settlers as Mafeking , but the name reverted to Mafikeng in 1980 following its incorporation into Bophuthatswana .
