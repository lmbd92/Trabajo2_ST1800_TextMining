Brought to Brooklyn in 2011 with the Guggenheim 's support , Sanatorium is a utopian clinic of topical treatments for those inner-city afflictions we are all too familiar with : stress , loneliness and hyper-stimulation . In two-hour windows , Sanatorium visitors experience up to 3 sessions from 16 options through meetings with a series of therapists . In therapy one gets to play and consider self . The cure is in the process , powered by what the individual is willing to give and unload . All 16 treatments are based on traditional methods of expression or respected forms of perception changing programming . Balancing reality and fiction , Sanatorium draws from Gestalt psychology , theater warm-up exercises , Fluxus events , conflict resolution techniques , trust-building games , corporate coaching , psychodrama , and hypnosis . In 2012 , Sanatorium can be seen at DOCUMENTA ( 13 ) in Kassel. # # ' ' Individual Exhibitions ( selection ) ' ' # # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK **6;365796;br 2011 Babymarx .
