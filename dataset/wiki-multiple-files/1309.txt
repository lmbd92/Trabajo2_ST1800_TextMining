@@7874514 The Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD ) is the new English NHS observational and interventional research service , jointly funded by the NHS National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR ) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) . CPRD will be working closely with the extensive primary care , topic specific and comprehensive NIHR research networks and with the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care . # History # # Value Added Information Medical Products # The programme that would develop into the current organisation was initially developed by an Essex general practitioner , Dr Alan Dean , to facilitate day-to-day management of his own general practice , in collaboration with IT staff at the BATA shoe factory in East Tilbury near to his practice . Early programmers included a Czech programmer Yan Boda . In 2007 , GPRD announced a strategic alliance with IMS Health , which incorporated GPRD and the IMS Disease Analyzer , resulting in the most comprehensive longitudinal anonymized patient-level data in Europe . Together , these two resources encompassed medical treatment information for nearly 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and IMS enabled pharmaceutical and biotech companies , as well as governments , payers , providers and the financial and healthcare supply sectors , to make critical decisions about the impact of medicines in clinical practice across different healthcare systems . GPRD could be linked to external disease registries on an individual patient level . Registries included the hospital episode statistics , death certificates , the national cancer registry and MINAP ( cardiovascular disease ) . # Launch of the CPRD # Following the announcement by the chancellor on the Plan for Growth , a commissioned study entitled the Research Capability Programme was initiated with the aim of assessing the available research capabilities of the UK and future potential growth areas in this sector . An opportunity was identified for the collaboration of the Department of Health and the MHRA in creating a joint research service , based upon consolidating and expanding existing independent services . The new service , known as the CPRD has been developed to meet the expectations and criteria outlined by the Plan for Growth . On 29 March 2012 , the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Research ( NIHR ) launched the Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD ) . On the launch of CPRD , Sir Kent Woods , Chief Executive of the MHRA said , The Clinical Practice Research Datalink will provide new data and research services that will improve the health of patients and also make the UK a world leader in life sciences research . David Willetts , Minister for Universities and Science , said , The UK is a world leader in life sciences , but both the research base and industry tell us that we could make better use of data in order to drive medical breakthroughs . The Clinical Practice Research Datalink will provide researchers with access to safeguarded data that respects patient confidentiality . This will give valuable insights into serious health conditions and ultimately help reduce the time it takes to develop new treatments . The GPRD became part of the data services provision from CPRD . At its launch in April 2012 , CPRD was established as the new , England-wide NHS observational and interventional research service . It has built on the research developments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( HRSS ) previously managed by the NIHR Research Capability Program . *The GPRD was a large primary care database , containing anonymised primary care data and links to a number of NHS and other data sources . The GPRD specialised in providing anonymised data and research service capabilities to a variety of medical and public health studies . *The HRSS was a pilot service to demonstrate the feasibility of research using a range of health-care information . The HRSS used its analyses and expertise linking large sets of anonymised data for research studies . # Work of the CPRD # The CPRD builds on its predecessors ' capabilities and aims to provide a range of services and products in the areas of medical research and public health care . Fundamental to the work of the CPRD is the collection and linkage of anonymised data sets and provision of research services . # Data # The CPRD utilises the maximum benefit of linked data sets and the UKs health system to provide researchers with access to high quality anonymous primary and secondary health care data . The data collected allows researches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primary Care drugs * Administered Hospital drugs * Laboratory data * Consultations * GP and hospital coded disease data * Disease Registers * Cancer Registers The NHS provides , free at the point of delivery , healthcare to a population of 52 Million in England . With access to the data sets of NHS in England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland the CPRD can provide a population of potentially up to 64 Million patients in the UK . Further access and partnerships have been established to include data sets from other European countries . The linking of anonomysed primary care data with large data registries and related data sets means the CPRD can offer a huge array of data and information for the inclusion in medical research studies . This will include areas such as ; prescription drugs uses and effect , long term patient treatment strategy , long term health benefit studies , epidemic and pandemic studies and demographic health and welfare studies . # Research Services # The CPRD has a range of research experience and expertise including : * Pharmacoepidemiology * Pharmacoeconomics * Research Guidance * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * Data verification services The CPRD provides consulting services for a range of research activities . Provided by an experienced internal team , the research service offers advice on research methodology and research governance as well as a host of other services . Drawing from its expertise and predecessors ' experience the CPRD research team has built a reputation for conducting high-end research projects , from protocol development , gaining approvals for research , data analysis and report and publication writing . The research capacity is such that the CPRD has the resource and expertise to undertake research projects on behalf of customers or independently , for a variety of undertakings from the commercial regulatory , charitable and academic sectors . A huge range of studies from the CPRD and predecessors have been published and a list of published papers can be found at # Interventional Research Services # The CPRD offers a range of interventional research services to facilitate the running of clinical trials . * The assessment of the feasibility of research proposals . * Data supply and verification services . * Randomisation into the study at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Long term follow up through routine data collection , minimising the problem of ' lost to follow up ' . * A framework for conducting pharmacogenetic studies . # Information collected by the CPRD # The primary health care data collected by the CPRD is taken from participating GP surgeries in the United Kingdom . Personal identifiers are not collected , protecting the privacy of the individuals from whom the data comes . Data collected includes ; * Demographics ( including age and sex ) * Medical symptoms , signs and diagnoses * Therapy ( medicines , vaccines , devices ) * Treatment outcomes * Events leading to withdrawal of a drug or treatment * Referrals to hospitals or specialists * Laboratory tests , pathology results * Lifestyle factors ( height , weight , BMI , smoking and alcohol consumption ) * Socioeconomic status * Patient registration , practice and consultation details
