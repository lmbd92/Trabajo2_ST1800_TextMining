The prominent crater Pauli lies across the southern rim of Roche , and the outer rampart of Pauli covers a portion of Roche 's interior floor . To the north-northwest of Roche is the crater Etvs , and just to the west-northwest lies Rosseland . The western rim of Roche has been somewhat distorted and straightened . The rim as a whole is worn and eroded , with multiple tiny craterlets marking the surface . The satellite crater Roche B lies across the northeastern inner wall . The interior floor of Roche is relatively level , but is also marked by several small and tiny craterlets . A grouping of these craters lies near the midpoint . Just to the northwest of this grouping is a bright patch of high-albedo material . Sections of the floor along the north-northwestern side have a lower albedo than elsewhere , usually an indication of basaltic-lava flows similar to what fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually be larger , but covered with higher-albedo ejecta. # Satellite craters # By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Roche .
