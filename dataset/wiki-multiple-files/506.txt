@@1925514 genre = Action ' ' Space Taxi ' ' is a computer game for the Commodore 64 . It was written by John Kutcher and published by MUSE Software in 1984 . The game is famous for featuring sampled speech uncommon in the early 1980s . The speech samples include ' ' Hey taxi ! ' ' , ' ' Pad one please ' ' ( and similar samples for different pads ) , ' ' Thanks ' ' and ' ' Up please ' ' . These are said in a variety of voice pitches , creating the feeling of different taxi customers . # Gameplay # ' ' Space Taxi ' ' is an action game . There are 24 different levels , all in sequential order , and the player has to complete all of them . ' ' Space Taxi ' ' simulates a flying taxi . The taxi is controlled by four thrusters and has landing gear that can be switched on or off . Switching landing gear on disables the side thrusters , but landing without landing gear destroys the taxi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing with high velocity or not landing properly ( i.e. having only one of the gear stands on the platform while having the other in midair ) . In each level , there is a set of numbered platforms . At regular intervals , a customer materializes out of nowhere , on a randomly selected platform . The player has to fly their taxi to that platform , whereupon the customer will enter the taxi , saying which platform he wants to go to . When the player takes him to that platform , he will pay the taxi fee and tip based upon how fast the trip takes and the smoothness of the landing . After each numbered platform has been successfully visited , the next customer will say Up please , whereupon the gate at the top of the level will open . Flying through the gate completes the level . One must also be careful not to land on or hit the customer with the taxi , not only because he will angrily yell HEY ! and then disappear , before appearing somewhere else on the platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is increasingly difficult on smaller platforms where the platform will barely fit the customer and the taxi . Each level features a different setting or theme ( such as a treat-strewn candyland or a snowy winter landscape ) , and most have some special feature to hinder the player 's job . Some of the features include a table tennis ball bouncing across the level , snowflakes falling from the sky , a series of radar masts interfering with the controls , or teleports that send the player to a random location . The taxi also has a limited fuel supply . The fuel level resets at the end of each level , but on some of the more complicated screens it is necessary to refuel . This is accomplished by flying to a special platform marked with an F and containing a gas pump . The player must pay for fuel out of the money he has earned . Passengers do not make allowances for pitstops , and their tip will continue to decrease as the player tanks up . The taxi 's fuel consumption is based upon the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used , so if a player needs to get from one side of the screen to the other , it consumes less fuel ( though is more dangerous ) to accelerate halfway across the screen and then reverse thrust , than to use one small thrust to move slowly across the screen and occasional upward thrusts to maintain altitude . After completing all levels , the player gets to a special mystery level , in which the player is greeted with the message Welcome to .. MUSEWORLD and three platforms , each with a figure relating to another Muse Software game : an ambulance representing ' ' Rescue Squad ' ' ( 1983 , also John F. Kutcher ) , the soldier with Hakenkreuz for ' ' Castle Wolfenstein ' ' ( 1981 , Silas S. Warner ) , and a shooting robot relating to ' ' RobotWar ' ' ( 1981 , Silas S. Warner ) . At the bottom below there is the actual mystery of the secret screen , the text says : Eat the pi e until a fire glows , then go up until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Menu ! ! ! . The bold words here are highlighted in the game in a different color and are the keys to get into the Secret Menu . Therefore the player must first enter the instruction page ( by pressing joystick down in the main menu ) and type in the keys related by the highlighted words : First pressing the -key until the word fire in the last line changes its color , then pressing the -key ( not the cursor key ) until the color gets black again . Then the player presses * and he or she will get to the secret menu with the following options : Record own demo , disable sprite kill , manual select for random levels and author information . # Levels # class= wikitable !
