She was the second U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the American Revolutionary War 's Battle of Yorktown . ' ' Yorktown ' ' was laid down by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in May 1887 and launched in April 1888 . She was just over 244 ft long and 36 ft abeam , and displaced 1710 LT . She was equipped with two steam engines which were supplemented with three schooner-rigged masts . The ship 's main battery consisted of six 6incm 1 guns and was augmented by an assortment of smaller-caliber guns . At launch , ' ' Yorktown ' ' joined the Squadron of Evolution of New Navy steel-hulled ships .

After that situation was resolved , ' ' Yorktown ' ' took part in the joint BritishAmerican sealing patrol in Alaskan waters and duty on the Asiatic Station before returning to the United States in 1898 . ' ' Yorktown ' ' was out of commission during the SpanishAmerican War , but took part in actions in the PhilippineAmerican War and the Boxer Rebellion in 1899 and 1900 , respectively , after she had been recommissioned . After three years out of commission from 1903 to 1906 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' hosted the Secretary of the Navy on board when he greeted the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1908 . Over the next five years , most of ' ' Yorktown ' ' s time was spent in sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports . From July 1912 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' was out of commission for alterations , but resumed duties off the Mexican , Nicaraguan , and Honduran coasts beginning in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' continued in the same role , until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918 . She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August , and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919 . After arrival at San Diego in February , she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919 ; she was sold in 1921 to an Oakland , California , firm and broken up that same year . # Design and construction # The ' ' Yorktown ' ' class gunboatsunofficially considered third-class cruiserswere the product of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good seakeeping abilities and , yet , able to carry a heavy battery . ' ' Yorktown ' ' was authorized in the 1886 fiscal year , and the contract for her construction was awarded to the William Cramp and Sons shipyard of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The hull for ' ' Yorktown ' ' was designed by the Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair while the mechanical design was left to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was laid on 14 May 1887 . The ship was launched on 28 April 1888 and sponsored by Mary Cameron , the daughter of U.S. Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania . The dynamite-gun cruiser was launched a few minutes after ' ' Yorktown ' ' in the same ceremony . According to a news account , 25 United States Senators , 180 Congressmen , the Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney , and the governors of six states attended the dual ceremony , many arriving from Washington , D.C. , via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 's passenger steamer . By 19 March 1889 , Cramp had completed ' ' Yorktown ' ' and was prepared to turn her over to the Navy . # Layout # As built , ' ' Yorktown ' ' was 244ft5 in in length and 36ft m abeam . Her steel hull had an average draft of 14ft m , which was expected to give her the ability to escape from larger ships into shallow water . At the waterline was a turtleback deck of -inch ( 9.5 mm ) steel that formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crown at the level of the waterline and curved downwards to 3 ft below the waterline at the sides of the ship . Below this armored deck were twelve compartments separated by watertight bulkheads ; the spaces above were equipped with watertight doors intended to be closed during battle . Above the armored deck , ' ' Yorktown ' ' had forecastle and poop decks with an open gun deck that spanned the length of the ship between them . The conning tower was located forward on the forecastle deck and was oval-shaped to deflect shot . It was outfitted with a steam-powered steering wheel , an telegraph , and speaking tubes ; it was protected by 2 in of steel armor plate . # Propulsion # ' ' Yorktown ' ' was powered by two triple-expansion steam engines which each drove one of the pair of 10.5ft m , three-bladed screw propellers . The cylinders of each engine were 22 , 31 , and 51 inches ( 56 , 79 , and 130 cm ) in diameter and had a 30in cm stroke . Each engine was rated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knots , though the ship exceeded that in her trials . The engines , situated in separate watertight compartments , were each fed by a pair of coal-fired boilers . Each boiler was horizontally mounted and was 9ft6 in in diameter and 17ft6 in in length with a total grate area of 220 sqin . ' ' Yorktown ' ' s coal bunkers could carry up to 400 LT of the fuel , and were shielded from shot and shell . At a near top-speed of 16 knots , the ship could cover 2800 nmi in 6 days ; at the more economical speed of 8 knots she could cruiser 12000 nmi over 62 days . To supplement her steam power plant , ' ' Yorktown ' ' was built with three masts that were schooner-rigged . She had a total sail area of 6300 sqft . The steam and sail combination was expected to allow ' ' Yorktown ' ' to remain at sea for months at a time during wartime . # Armament # ' ' Yorktown ' ' s main battery consisted of six 6incm 1/30 guns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gun barrels ; in this case , the gun is 30 calibers , meaning that the gun is 30 times long as it is in diameter . with each gun weighing in excess of 11000 lbs . Two were mounted on the forecastle deck , two on the poop deck , and the other pair amidships on the gun deck . The two guns on the gun deck were mounted 10 ft above the waterline , while the other four were 18 ft above . The guns fired 105lbs kg armor-piercing projectiles with a propellant charge weighing 18.8lbs kg at convert . At an elevation of 30.2 , the guns had a range of 18000 yards . Each gun was shielded with steel plating 3 in thick . ' ' Yorktown ' ' s secondary battery consisted of two 6 pdr guns with a caliber of 57mmin2 abbr=on , two 3 pdr guns 47mmin2 abbr=on , and two 1 pdr guns 37mmin2 abbr=on . All were based on designs of the French arms company Hotchkiss . According to a 1902 Bureau of Ordnance publication , an armor-piercing round fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a distance of 1000yards m. # 18891897 # The ship was commissioned at the League Island ( Philadelphia ) Navy Yard on 23 April 1889 under the command of Commander French E. Chadwick . After ' ' Yorktown ' ' conducted her final sea trials , she was assigned to the Squadron of Evolution sometimes also referred to as the White Squadron in late 1889 . ' ' Yorktown ' ' operated with that unit as it developed tactical maneuvers for use by the new steel-hulled naval vessels then coming into service in the United States Navy . After this duty , ' ' Yorktown ' ' departed the east coast of the United States on 7 December 1889 , bound for European waters ; stopped briefly at Fayal in the Azores ; and arrived at Lisbon , Portugal , two days before Christmas . The ship subsequently cruised the Mediterranean into the early spring of the following year , calling at ports in Spain , Morocco , France , Italy , Greece , and Malta . Following her return to the United States on 17 June 1890 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 July for repairs that lasted until 8 August . Upon the completion of these alterations , ' ' Yorktown ' ' took part in the ceremonies marking the embarkation of the remains of the noted inventor , John Ericssonof famefor transportation back to his native Sweden for burial . ' ' Yorktown ' ' next again operated in the Squadron of Evolution off the eastern seaboard and into the Gulf of Mexico into the summer of 1891 . Under Acting Rear Admiral John G. Walker , the squadron normally cruised in the Gulf of Mexico from January to April and off the east coast from May to October . While in the gulf , the ships called at Galveston , Texas ; New Orleans ; and Pensacola , Florida ; and carried out target practice in Tampa Bay . Later , the squadron conducted small arms practice at Yorktown , Virginia , after arriving at Hampton Roads . In July 1891 , the squadron carried out exercises and maneuvers in connection with the naval militias of New York and Massachusetts during which it added torpedo attacks upon the Fleet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drills and landing exercises . The Secretary of the Navy 's report for the fiscal year 1891 noted that useful experience had been gained by the Squadron of Evolution in the training of commanding , navigating , and watch officers in skillfully and safely maneuvering vessels in formation and in restricted waters . In addition , engineers were trained in regulating and maintaining economical coal consumption . # ' ' Baltimore ' ' crisis # On 8 October 1891 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' , under the command of Commander Robley D. Evans , departed New York to join the Pacific Squadron . The gunboat put in to Charlotte Amalie , Danish West Indies , to coal ship on 14 October . While the ship was engaged in this duty , ' ' Yorktown ' ' was ordered to Valparaso , Chile , in response to the ' ' Baltimore ' ' Crisis . During the 1891 Chilean Civil War , the ' ' Itata ' ' , a cargo ship employed by Chilean Congressionalists , had loaded weaponry in California , but was detained in San Diego by U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slip away from San Diego , caught up with the ship at the Chilean port of Iquique in July 1891 and escorted the ship back to San Diego before her cargo could be unloaded . In October , some months after the ' ' Itata ' ' Incident had ended , the American cruiser put in at Valparaso . On 16 October , a group of sailors from ' ' Baltimore ' ' ashore on liberty were attacked by Congressionalists , still angry at the ' ' Itata ' ' affair . Two of ' ' Baltimore ' ' s sailors were killed and eighteen wounded ; thirty-six other American sailors were arrested by the local authorities . Tensions ran high in both Chile and the United States . ' ' Yorktown ' ' , a part of the United States ' response , departed Charlotte Amalie for Valparaso on 17 October for a six-week , storm-tossed voyage around the South American continent via the Straits of Magellan . Less than two weeks after ' ' Yorktown ' ' s 30 November arrival , ' ' Baltimore ' ' departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Yorktown ' ' . Over the ensuing weeks , Chile and the United States came close to war , but cooler heads prevailed . Locally , Evans ' patience was dangerously tested , but it held . One inflammatory incident occurred when Chilean torpedo boats bore down on Evans ' ship , turning their helms hard over at the last possible instant to avoid a collision . On another occasion , a group of locals threw rocks at Evans and his gig as it lay at the foot of a jetty . After a month at Valparaso , ' ' Yorktown ' ' took on refugees from the American , Spanish , and Italian legations in mid-January 1892 . She got underway on the 19th and arrived at Callao , Peru , on the 25th . While ' ' Yorktown ' ' lay anchored there , tension between the United States and Chile relaxed and the crisis abated , and the Chilean later government provided compensation for the families of the American sailors that were killed . # Sealing patrol # ' ' Yorktown ' ' stood out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego and San Francisco , and eventually arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard , Vallejo , California . The gunboat subsequently underwent repairs there until late in the following month . Having weathered one diplomatic storm and international incident , Evans and his command soon set sail on another mission that , if handled wrongly , could have caused ill-feeling with the British . That spring , ' ' Yorktown ' ' along with two other naval vessels and a trio of revenue cuttersheaded toward Arctic waters on 27 April to protect the great herds of seals in the Bering Sea from poachers . Traveling along the west coast of the United States , the gunboat and her crew braced , in Evans ' words , at the prospect of doing something . As at Valparaso , Evans faced the possibility of becoming involved in an international incident arising from possible confrontations with Canadian sealers . Operating under the protection of the British crown , the latter had taken particularly heavy catches . Many American vessels put to sea under the British flag in an attempt to evade prosecution by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to the slaughter of seals and decided upon joint action with the United States in prosecuting the poachers . About 110 schooners , large and small , made up the sealing fleet , typically armed with double-barrelled shotguns for killing the animals and Winchester rifles for dealing with any humans who attempted to interfere . The fact that the great majority of seals killed had been female still with young in many casesalmost doubled the toll of slain seals . As Evans noted : the slaughter in the North Pacific was fearful . Arriving at Port Townsend , Washington , on 30 April , ' ' Yorktown ' ' put to sea on 13 May , arriving at Iliuliuk , Unalaska , one week later . Coaling there , the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the Pribilof Islands , reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers . Assisted by a revenue cutter , ' ' Yorktown ' ' guarded the passes to the Bering Sea . The crews of the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on in spite of the hardships imposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved abundant . Codfish was the staple with an occasional gourmet treat of salmon . # Telescopic gunsight # Besides the patrols made during this deployment in northwestern waters , ' ' Yorktown ' ' conducted routine operations such as target practices . Among the officers assigned to the ship at that time was Lt. Bradley Fiske , a young officer who had invented and constructed a practical telescopic gunsight . Fiske 's sight had been tested in ' ' Baltimore ' ' and had favorably impressed that ship 's officersincluding her commander , Captain Winfeld S. Schley . Evans , however , had not taken a liking to Fiske 's newfangled gadget but nevertheless consented to allow a second test on board ' ' Yorktown ' ' ( the first one had failed miserably ) . On the afternoon of 22 September 1892 , during scheduled target practice , Fiske 's invention worked as designed and elicited praise from Evans . As Fiske himself later wrote in the United States Naval Institute 's magazine ' ' Proceedings ' ' , modern naval gunnery had its birth not in the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in ' ' Yorktown ' ' . ' ' Yorktown ' ' continued her task of patrolling until 21 September when she departed Unalaska for the Mare Island Navy Yard . From 11 to 24 October , the ship underwent repairs there before proceeding on to the east coast via Cape Horn . ' ' Yorktown ' ' eventually arrived at Norfolk , Virginia , on 24 February 1893 . After repairs at the New York Navy Yard from 25 April to 26 July , ' ' Yorktown ' ' retraced her route south and sailed again around Cape Horn back into the Pacific . She then moved north to resume patrolling the Bering Sea . She protected seal rookeries into 1894 before returning to Mare Island for repairs which lasted into mid-September . On 24 September 1894 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' sailed for the western Pacific and duty on the Asiatic Station . Sailing via Honolulu , she reached Yokohama , Japan , on 8 December 1894 and spent the next three years , under the command of Commander Charles Stockton touching at the principal ports-of-call along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the autumn of 1897 and made port at Mare Island on 18 November 1897 . Subsequently laid up at Mare Island and decommissioned on 8 December , the gunboat remained inactive there through the Spanish-American War in 1898. # 18981903 # Recommissioned on 17 November 1898 , with Commander Charles S. Sperry in command , ' ' Yorktown ' ' sailed again for the Far East on 7 January 1899 . Rumors of German machinations in Samoa lengthened ' ' Yorktown ' ' s stay at Hawaii from a few days to a few weeks ; but , when the anticipated trouble failed to materialize , ' ' Yorktown ' ' resumed her voyage to the Philippine Islands . On 23 February , she arrived at Cavite Navy Yard , near Manila where patrolled to prevent gun-runners thought to be supplying guns and ammunition to the ' ' Insurrectos ' ' , Filipinos fighting for independence . At one point , rumors flew concerning possible German gun-running activities ; and ' ' Yorktown ' ' patrolled off the entrance to Subic Bay and from thence to Lingayen to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work over the next three years , cooperating with the Army , transporting and convoying troops , and patrolling wide areas of often badly charted waters . Upon occasion , ' ' Yorktown ' ' served as mother ship to smaller gunboats , providing officers and men to staff the smaller patrol craft . Ensigns William Harrison Standley and Harry E. Yarnell ( both future admirals ) and future naval historian and archivist Dudley Wright Knox were among the junior officers who served in ' ' Yorktown ' ' during this time . # Philippine-American War # During the Philippine-American War , ' ' Yorktown ' ' stood in to Baler Bay , on the west coast of Luzon , on 11 April 1899 , on a mission to relieve a Spanish garrison that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months . Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship 's whaleboat provided a decoy , ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river . Meanwhile , Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter . The next day , Gillmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aground too far from the river 's mouth and out of sight of ' ' Yorktown ' ' . Filipino troops , hidden in the jungle-covered banks , raked the boat with rifle fire . Two American sailors were killed ; two were mortally wounded ; and the remainder , including Gillmore , were slightly wounded . The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops . Standley completed his mission and , together with the enlisted signalman , made it back to the ship . # Boxer Rebellion # In 1899 , the situation in China worsened until it culminated in the Boxer Rebellion . The following spring , ' ' Yorktown ' ' was withdrawn from her patrol duties in the northern Philippines to provide assistance to the operations off the coast of North China . She departed Manila on 3 April 1900 , bound for China ; and , after she reached the mainland , her landing force served ashore at Taku . In addition , Marines from ' ' Yorktown ' ' participated in the actions at Tientsin between June and July . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1901 , she continued to support the China Relief Expedition forces . In June 1900 , she assisted back off a reef near that Chinese port . # 19001903 # The gunboat departed Shanghai on 10 September 1900 and reached Cavite on the 17th . In the Philippines , she resumed her cooperation with Army forces , still engaged in pacification operations , and continued these duties for the next two years . In between pacification missions , she performed survey work : at Guam in November 1901 and at Dumanquillas Bay , Philippines , in February 1903 . In April 1902 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' s Coxswain Joseph Quick rescued a shipmate from drowning while the ship was in port at Yokohama , Japan . For his efforts , Quick was awarded a peacetime Medal of Honor . ' ' Yorktown ' ' departed the Far East in early 1903 and returned to Mare Island on 3 June . Two weeks later , on the 17th , she was decommissioned. # 19061912 # Recommissioned at Mare Island on 1 October 1906 , with Commander Richard T. Mulligan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there until 9 November . Underway on that day , she operated off the west coasts of Mexico , Honduras , and Nicaragua into the following summer . After repairs at San Francisco and Mare Island , ' ' Yorktown ' ' conducted target practice at Magdalena Bay , Mexico , and relieved as station ship at Acapulco . She then cruised with the 2d Squadron of the Pacific Fleet to Magdalena Bay and San Francisco . Over the ensuing months , ' ' Yorktown ' ' continued her regular local operations . ' ' Yorktown ' ' hosted the Secretary of the Navy , Victor H. Metcalf , to witness the arrival of the Great White Fleetcommanded by ' ' Yorktown ' ' s former commander , Robley Fightin ' Bob Evansinto San Francisco . The fleet arrived on 6 May 1908 , and the flagship saluted the secretary 's flag on ' ' Yorktown ' ' with the discharge of seventeen guns . Metcalf also boarded ' ' Yorktown ' ' on the 8th to review the assembled battleships , armored cruisers , and torpedo boats of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' Yorktown ' ' participated in festivities for the Rose Festival at Portland , Oregon . From June to September , ' ' Yorktown ' ' conducted seal patrols in Alaskan waters , out of Nome , Unalaska , and Sitka and , between 15 and 19 September , established a site for a wireless station at Valdez . Afterwards , ' ' Yorktown ' ' sailed south to rejoin the Pacific Fleet , conducting battle practices between 19 November and 1 December at Magdalena Bay . She later joined the armored cruisers and and the tender at Acajutla , El Salvador , before sailing for Corinto , Nicaragua , in March 1909 . After more target practices at Magdalena Bay , ' ' Yorktown ' ' was repaired at Mare Island in June and into July before shifting to Seattle , to participate in festivities for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition . Later in July , the ship visited Esquimalt , British Columbia . She subsequently cruised off the Pacific coast and participated in the Portol Festival at San Francisco in October . From 13 December 1909 to 27 March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nicaragua , with the Nicaraguan Expeditionary Squadron . She then pursued a schedule of exercises and maneuvers , operating between California and British Columbia through June and July . She returned to a posture of readiness off Corinto and San Juan del Sur between 13 August and 7 September . She then operated off Ecuadorian , Colombian , and Peruvian ports , with the United States Consul General at Large embarked , between 19 September and 16 October before putting into Panama for coal and stores . She subsequently patrolled at Amapala , Honduras , and the familiar Corinto for most of November and December . She spent Christmas at Corinto before shifting to Amapala , en route to San Francisco and Mare Island . From March to July 1911 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' cruised off the west coasts of Mexico , Nicaragua , and Honduras . On 29 May , she rescued the survivors from the foundered Panamanian steamer , which had sunk with the loss of 60 of its 100 passengers and crew . Another period of repairs and upkeep in the late summer of 1911 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South and Central America . She returned to Mare Island in May 1912 , and was decommissioned there for alterations on 15 July . # 19131919 # Recommissioned on 1 April 1913 , with Commander George B. Bradshaw in command , ' ' Yorktown ' ' operated out of San Diego on shakedown into mid-April . She was soon back at Corinto , however , remaining in Nicaragua until 5 June . After a brief period of operations off the coast , she returned to Corinto on 21 June and remained there for over a month before departing on 31 July to coal at Salina Cruz , Mexico . She moved to Mazatln on 10 August and there picked up mail , delivering it to the port of Topolobampo , Mexico , on the 11th . ' ' Yorktown ' ' remained there until mid-September . For the remainder of 1913 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' conducted local operations out of San Diego and San Francisco . In January 1914 , though , the gunboat returned to Mexican waters and investigated local conditions at Ensenada between 3 and 6 January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexican ports : Mazatln , San Blas , Miramar , Topolobampo , and La Paz . Following an overhaul at Mare Island from 24 June to 2 September 1914 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' served in Mexican waters again into June 1915 . From that point until the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' continued her routine of patrols off Mexican , Nicaraguan , and Honduran ports with occasional repairs at Mare Island and maneuvers out of San Diego . After the United States joined the Allies , ' ' Yorktown ' ' operated off the coast of Mexico until August 1917 , when she paused briefly at San Diego . On 18 July 1917 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' rescued the last surviving members of an abandoned guano mining settlement on Clipperton Island . From a peak population of roughly 100 in 1915 , only four women and seven children survived . After her time off the Mexican coast , ' ' Yorktown ' ' then cruised off the west coasts of Central and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' Yorktown ' ' , sailed for the east coast on 28 April 1918 , transiting the Panama Canal en route , and arrived at New York on 20 August . The gunboat escorted a coastal convoy to Halifax , soon there after before returning to New York . She performed local coastwise escort duties through the end of World War I. After a period of upkeep at the New York Navy Yard in December , she departed the east coast on 2 January 1919 on her last voyage to California . Arriving at San Diego on 15 February 1919 , ' ' Yorktown ' ' was placed out of commission at Mare Island on 12 June 1919 . On 17 June 1920 , she was assigned the hull number ' ' PG-1 ' ' . The veteran steel-hulled gunboat was sold to the Union Hide Company of Oakland , California , on 30 September 1921 ; she was broken up in Oakland sometime after that . # Notes # # References # # Bibliography # * * * *
