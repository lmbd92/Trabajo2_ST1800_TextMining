@@37671514 Stage 10 of the Cambrian is the still unnamed third and final stage of the Furongian Series . It follows the Jiangshanian and precedes the Ordovician Tremadocian Stage . The proposed lower boundary is the first appearance of the trilobite ' ' Lotagnostus americanus ' ' around million years ago , but other fossils are also being discussed ( see below ) . The upper boundary is defined as the appearance of the conodont ' ' Iapetognathus fluctivagus ' ' which marks the beginning of the Tremadocian and is radiometrically dated as million years ago . # Naming # The 10th stage of the Cambrian has not been formally named by the ICS yet , although a number of local names exist . Several authors favor the name Lawsonian after Lawson Cove , in the Wah Wah Mountains of Utah . # Stratotype # The ICS is still discussing which geological section and biostratigraphic marker will be used to define the base of the 10th Cambrian stage . Likely candidates for the section are still investigated . A first proposal was a section near Duibian , Zhejiang province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House Range of Utah . If a conodont is used for the base the stage then many more sections would be likely candidates for the GSSP , e.g. in Australia , Kazakhstan and Canada . Candidates for the biostratigraphic marker are the first appearance of a trilobite or conodont species . The trilobite ' ' Lotagnostus americanus ' ' was first suggested by the ICS , but has proven to be problematic . In 2006 another working group proposed the first appearance of ' ' Cordylodus andresi ' ' . Currently the first appearance of ' ' Eoconodontus notchpeakensis ' ' is favored by many authors because it is globally widespread and is independent of facies ( known from continental rise to peritidal environments ) . The ' ' Eoconodontus notchpeakensis ' ' proposal would also incorporate a non-biostratigraphic marker to correlate the beginning of Stage 10 globally . A carbon isotope excursion ( the HERB-event ) occurs in the lower part of the ' ' E. notchpeakensis ' ' range . # Subdivisions # Cambrian Stage 10 can be subdivided using different biostratigraphic zones . Several conodont zone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trilobites. # References #
