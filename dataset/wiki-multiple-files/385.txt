Most vocal in their objections are neighbors Vic Frohmeyer ( Dan Aykroyd ) and Walt Scheel ( M. Emmet Walsh ) . Vic , who 's the unelected leader of the street , organizes a campaign to force the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the coveted award for best decorations . Walt does n't seem to like Luther , so his efforts are primarily personal . However , it is revealed that Walt 's wife Bev is suffering from cancer , perhaps dampening his holiday spirits . Children picket , led by Vic 's son Spike ( Erik Per Sullivan ) , neighbors constantly call , and Christmas carolers try to revive the Kranks ' holiday spirit by singing on their lawn which Luther stops them by freezing his front lawn . Even the newspaper gets into the act by publishing a front page story complete with a photograph of the unlit Krank house and states that the Kranks ' street has lost the prize and won sixth place because of how Luther and Nora refused to decorate their house . Still , Luther and Nora continue to stand their ground . The two are in the process of packing on Christmas Eve morning when they receive a call from Blair , who announces she 's at Miami International Airport , en route home with her Peruvian fianc as a surprise for her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's holiday traditions , and when she asks if they 're having their usual party that night , a panicked Nora says yes . Comic chaos ensues as the couple finds themselves trying to decorate the house and coordinate a party with only twelve hours to spare before their daughter and future son-in-law arrive . While Nora scrambles to find food , especially Blair 's favorite honey flavored ham , Luther goes to buy a tree from the Boy Scouts but they only have one worthless non-green tree left since their sales went big and rapid . Luther decides to give a donation by giving them money but taking the tree in the process ; he then rejects it by throwing it in his backyard . While Spike leads a picket at the Kranks ' , Luther arranges to borrow the tree of neighbor Wes Trogdon who is going away for a week with his kids and wife to close relatives being given the warning that he is not to break one ornament or damage it .

Spike comes to Luther 's rescue by showing the neighbors and officers that Luther has Trogdon 's keys and thus was given permission to borrow the tree . Nora comes home enraged at Luther for making the borrowed Christmas tree a Disaster and how she had to buy Smoked Trout to replace the honey ham . Once it is established why Luther is trying frantically to decorate his home , the neighbors , led by Vic , come out full force to help him and Nora ready it for Blair . Blair calls to say she landed from Miami ; despite this , she is sent by a police transport to their house thus leaving her still unknown of the chaos . After subtly giving everybody including Blair and Enrique , an unthankful and non-friendly toast , Luther tries to convince Nora to accept the cruise when she confronts him for the toast , but she refuses , disgusted that he is n't happy that Blair 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house and goes across the street to the Scheel home . Bev 's cancer , once in remission , has returned and , knowing this may be their last holiday together , Luther insists they take the cruise in place of him and Nora , going so far as to offer to take care of their hated cat , Muffles .
