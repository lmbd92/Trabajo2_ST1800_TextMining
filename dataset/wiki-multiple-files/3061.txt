Simon Vozick-Levinson of ' ' Entertainment Weekly ' ' gave ' ' 5.0 ' ' a B rating and commented that on ' ' 5.0 ' ' Nelly makes a reasonably convincing case that he can keep the momentum going . His lyrics are vacuous as ever , but those hooks sure are sticky .

Concepcion concluded her review by saying that The 36-year-old artist gives fans the stuff they fell in love with 10 years ago on debut ' ' Country Grammar ' ' and with a new pop-driven sound , he demonstrates he has n't lost a beat . Ken Capobianco from ' ' The Boston Globe ' ' said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tuneful mainstream effort that should yield a number of hits . Capobianco said that Just a Dream captures the design of many of these cuts : Hooks are prominent while Nelly 's patented tricky flow is often smoothed out .

Jesse Cataldo from Slant Magazine gave the album a rating of two stars ( out of five ) . Cataldo said that ' ' 5.0 ' ' is never overtly awful , but it definitely sinks into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albums , where they sit like dishes moldering beneath dirty water . Cataldo said that Nelly has lost his charm and playfulness he began with on the albums following ' ' Country Grammar ' ' . He felt that what is left is a murky stew of withered affections and grasps at modernity , from siren effects to processed horns and Auto-Tune breakdowns . Cataldo said that the album contains A collection of collaborations with low-wattage names and also-rans , it basically indicates that even if Nelly is still trying ( which he does n't seem to be ) , he has n't sustained the credibility to achieve a plausible comeback . Andy Kellman from Allmusic also gave the album two stars ( out of five ) . Kellman said that nothing on the rappers sixth studio album encourages repeated listening . He felt that Nellys exuberance often sounds feigned , the rallying choruses are not effective , and he s short on ideas . Kellman concluded his review by saying that ' ' 5.0 ' ' is by a considerable margin , Nellys least essential release to date . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from album booklet . * Track five , Making Movies and track nine , Do n't It Feel Good , features uncredited vocals by Rico Love . ; Sample credits * Track two , Long Gone , contains a sample of Let 's Start Love Over , as performed by Miles Jaye. * Track seven , 1000 Stacks , features a sample of Everyday Struggle , written by Christopher Wallace , Dave Grusin , Harvey Mason , Norman Glover , Reginald Ellis , embodies portions of Kick in the Door , written by Christopher Wallace , Christopher Martin and Jalacy Hawkins , both performed by The Notorious B.I.G . and uncredited vocals by Diddy. * Track fifteen , k.I.s.s , contains portions of Kissing You , written by Julian Jackson , Brion James , Janice Johnson and Charles Wiggins . # Credits and personnel # Adapted from Allmusic and album booklet . ; Creativity and management * Cornell Haynes , Jr .
