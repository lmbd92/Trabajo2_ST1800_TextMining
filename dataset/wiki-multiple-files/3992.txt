Meanwhile , Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) is preparing to leave and regrets the way things ended with Liz , but his attempts to make it up to her are rejected . Tearfully , he appeals to Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) for advice on how to repair the pair 's broken friendship , but she warns him that she has never known Liz to let a grudge go . Finally , network president Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) wants Jenna to pick an emotional musical number that she can perform at the close of the final show . Both Liz 's problems escalate as Tracy bribes Al Roker to run a news report that a snowicane is headed for the city , and Lutz decides to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other writers . Meanwhile , Jack begins to act more and more strangely , giving away his personal possessions and walking around the ' ' TGS ' ' studio declaring his love and appreciation for everyone . Pete ( Scott Adsit ) theorises that he could be planning to commit suicide , before suggesting that a real man would opt instead to fake his own death , an idea he becomes suspiciously enamored with . Liz initially dismisses this , but grows concerned when Jack suggests he 'll be at the final show in spirit . Elsewhere , Jenna decides that , following her unsuccessful attempts to make it in dramatic television and movies , she will return to her first love , Broadway , and picks the song from her upcoming musical ' ' The Rural Juror ' ' as her final performance for ' ' TGS ' ' . However , upon hearing it , Kenneth is concerned that Jenna 's performance lacks real emotion , and that she does not genuinely care that the show is ending . In the writers ' room , Lutz remains five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose another lunch picker , proclaiming that ordering Blimpie is his revenge on them for having constantly picked on him , unprovoked , for the last seven years . Liz overcomes him and locks him in her office , but he escapes through the ceiling panels and lands right on top of their new lunch choice , finally getting his triumphant victory as they concede to order from Blimpie . Kenneth returns to Jenna 's dressing room with two removal men in tow and informs her that he needs to take her mirror , because Brian Williams wants it for his bathroom . Suddenly , she breaks down in tears as she realises that ' ' TGS ' ' is over for good , and that she will miss something after all , if only her mirror . As the final broadcast approaches , Tracy disappears and Grizz ( Grizz Chapman ) and Dot Com ( Kevin Brown ) reveal that he is hiding out at Dark Sensations , the strip club to which he had taken Liz when they 'd first met . She confronts him and he explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , but because he has feared saying goodbye to people ever since he was young , and his father went out for cigarettes and never returned . Liz confesses that it is possible that they wo n't remain friends after ' ' TGS ' ' , because people naturally drift apart , but that she loves him despite everything he has put her through . Tracy appreciates her honesty and agrees to return . At the final recording , Jenna tells Tracy that she will miss him , and the pair embrace . However , Jack is suspiciously absent , and another conversation with Pete about faking his own death leads Liz to believe that Jack is indeed planning to commit suicide . Her fears are confirmed when she discovers a video suicide note in his office , and she tracks his phone to the waterfront , where he is preparing to leave on a boat . He explains that he plans to go away to find what makes him happy , and that he only led her to believe he wanted to kill himself because he was afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold her grudge . He goes on to confess that over the last seven years , she was one thing that consistently made him happy , and the pair acknowledge that they love each other as friends . Jack makes off on his boat , but turns around almost immediately and declares that he 's found the answer ; the best idea he 's ever had : dishwashers you can see into . At ' ' TGS ' ' , Tracy thanks the audience for tuning in for the past seven years , as Jenna emotionally performs her final song . # Epilogue # One year later , Pete has faked his own death and started a new life , but is found by his wife ; Liz is producing Grizz 's new sitcom ' ' Grizz &amp; Herz ' ' , and has taken her children to work ; she has also stayed in touch with Tracy , whose father has finally returned from getting cigarettes ; Jenna is attempting to steal a Tony Award from Alice Ripley ; Jack 's creation of the see-through dishwasher has led him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is still friends with Liz . In homage to the ' ' St. Elsewhere ' ' finale , an immortal Kenneth holds a snow globe containing the Rockefeller Center , as he hears Liz 's great-granddaughter 's pitch for a show based on the stories Liz had told her about working at ' ' TGS ' ' . # Reception # The hour-long broadcast of Hogcock ! and Last Lunch was watched by 4.88 million viewers and earned a 1.9 rating/5 share in the 1849 demographic . This means that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . This represented a season high in total viewers and in the demographic , an increase of two million viewers over the previous season finale and the highest-rated episode of the series , in overall viewers , for two years . When data obtained from DVR viewers who watched the episode within seven days of broadcast was factored in , total viewership for the finale increased by 25 percent , to 6.13 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent , to a 2.6 rating . The series finale received acclaim from critics and from fans of the series . Alan Sepinwall of ' ' HitFix ' ' opined that the finale gave these ridiculous cartoon characters three dimensions for at least a few moments so they could say proper goodbyes to each other , and to us . He elaborated that Liz and Tracy back at the strip club was a blunt but heartfelt summation of their whole relationship , and Jack on the boat giving a long preamble about the true nature of their friendship before saying that he loved Liz ( which Liz spared him from actually having to do by saying it to him first ) was a thing of beauty . In conclusion , he wrote that he would miss this show , but this ending felt close to perfect . Roth Cornet of ' ' IGN ' ' gave the episode a masterpiece 10 out of 10 and commented ' ' 30 Rock ' ' had the rare ability to provide both comedy and earned sentiment . That has never been more true than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his roots , his true-love , after a gloriously short-lived soul searching sea adventure : housewares . Liz , once and for all , embraces the fact that , yes , you can have it all , but having it all ultimately means truly knowing and accepting yourself , and having the willingness to compromise . And with that , a series that could have been an ingenious bit of comedy , but not much more , became a show about people and relationships that will stay with us well past the final fade to black tonight . Pilot Viruet of ' ' The A.V. Club ' ' awarded the episode an A and singled out two scenes in particular as perfect : The first is Liz meeting Tracy at the strip club they visited in the pilot and , while admitting that its possible they wont be friends after this , admitting she still does sincerely love him . The second scene is , if sic course , Jacks suicide fakeout , which he staged as a way to prove that Liz Lemon would miss him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be seen in plenty of future sitcoms ... and while its a shame to see it go , its great to see it go out on such a high note . Amy Amatangelo of ' ' Paste ' ' scored the episode a 9.3 out of 10 and opined that Its hard to create a series finale that will make every fan happy . But ' ' 30 Rock ' ' , which is going out still very close to the top of its game , came very close . There was so much to love about the episode : Lizs frighteningly spot-on fights with the moms at Gothammoms.com . Jenna landing in LA , seeing the competition , and high-tailing it right back to New York . The show getting in a few last digs at NBC . Plenty of Grizz and Dot Com . What appeared to be the shows real crew in the final ' ' TGS ' ' shot . The return of Jonathan . Tracy spelling out his name for Kenneths receptionist ( R as in the pirate noise , A as in the Fonzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant look in the mirror to confirm that shes crying . Sure , I could have done without the Lutz demand for Blimpies as the last lunch , but I quibble . James Poniewozik of ' ' Time ' ' commented that In some ways , last weeks episode felt more like a finale , in that it put a period on several stories : Liz got her kids , ' ' TGS ' ' hit the end of its run , Jack got Kabletown and Kenneth became president of NBC . The last hour , on the other hand , was a goodbyein a ' ' 30 Rock ' ' -ian meta sense , it was like the one more episode that ' ' TGS ' ' itself had to make , because we werent quite ready to stop and added And Im glad we got that epilogue , because as neatly as the rest of this shortened final season wrapped up ' ' 30 Rocks ' ' plotlines , this last hour captured its emotion . Tom Gliatto of ' ' People ' ' praised the episode as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that the characters were full of the sparkling , absurd liveliness that characterized the show at its best throughout seven seasons . He concluded that With its endless supply of shiny , shapely little jokes , the show could feel like a wonderful salad served up without a bowl . You got tired of being showered with lovely microgreens . This time we got the bowl . It was a lovely burnished wood . Brian Lowry of ' ' Variety ' ' was slightly less favourable , commenting The finale earns points for ambition and nostalgia . There are the obligatory celebrity cameos , some very clever lines , a nifty callback to the pilot , and a kicker that exhibits a real love for television a lot of the audience probably wo n't understand it . But the whole thing is a little too precious and yes , weird - frittering away too much time on the supporting players ... before getting to the really good stuff .
