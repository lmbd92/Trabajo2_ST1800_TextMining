@@3541514 A corbel arch ( or corbeled / corbelled arch ) is an arch-like construction method that uses the architectural technique of corbeling to span a space or void in a structure , such as an entranceway in a wall or as the span of a bridge . A corbel vault uses this technique to support the superstructure of a building 's roof . A corbel arch is constructed by offsetting successive courses of stone ( or brick ) at the springline of the walls so that they project towards the archway 's center from each supporting side , until the courses meet at the apex of the archway ( often , the last gap is bridged with a flat stone ) . For a corbeled vault covering the technique is extended in three dimensions along the lengths of two opposing walls . Although an improvement in load-bearing efficiency over the post and lintel design , corbeled arches are not entirely self-supporting structures , and the corbeled arch is sometimes termed a false arch for this reason .
