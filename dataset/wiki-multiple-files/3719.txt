@@34976514 After World War II and the collapse of the country 's monarchy , the French attempted to re-establish its colonial rule but ultimately failed in the First Indochina War . The Geneva Accords in 1954 partitioned the country temporarily in two with a promise of democratic election in 1956 to reunite the country . However , the United States and South Vietnam insisted on United Nations supervision of any election to prevent fraud , which the Soviet Union and North Vietnam refused . The Vietnam War ended with the Fall of Saigon in 1975 . After the reunification in 1975 , Vietnam suffered further internal repression and isolation from the international community due to the Cold War , Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and an American economic embargo . In 1986 , the Communist Party of Vietnam changed its economic policy and began reforms of the private sector similar to those in the China .

French interests , economic and cultural , in Viet Nam . The seat of the conference was held at either Hanoi , Saigon or Paris . In 1947 full scale war broke out between the Viet Minh and France . Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide , France fashioned a semi-independent State of Vietnam , within the French Union , with Bo i as Head of State .

The Vit Minh force grew significantly with China 's assistance and in 1954 , under the command of General V Nguyn Gip , launched a major siege against French bases in in Bin Ph .

Ng nh Dim , a former mandarin with a strong Catholic and Confucian background , was selected as Premier of the State of Vietnam by Bo i . While Dim was trying to settle the differences between the various armed militias in the South , Bo i was persuaded to reduce his power . Dim created a referendum in 1955 to depose Bo i and declared himself President of the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) . The Republic of Vietnam ( RVN ) was proclaimed in Saigon on October 26 , 1955 .

At the same time , Viet Minh armed forces from South Vietnam were also moving to North Vietnam , as dictated by the Geneva Accord . However , some high-ranking Viet Minh cadres secretly remained in the South to follow the local situation closely , and created a communist insurgency against the Southern government if necessary . The most important figure among those was L Dun . The Geneva Accord had promised elections to determine the government for a unified Vietnam . Neither the United States government nor Ng nh Dim 's State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference . With respect to the question of reunification , the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam , but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Viet Minh delegate Phm Vn ng , who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of local commissions . The United States countered with what became known as the American Plan , with the support of South Vietnam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supervision of the United Nations , but was rejected by the Soviet delegation . Dim took strong measures to secure South Vietnam from perceived internal threats , especially from the Viet Cong . He eliminated all private militias from the Bnh Xuyn Party and the Cao i and Ha Ho religious sects . In October 1955 , he deposed Bo i and proclaimed himself President of the newly established the Republic of Vietnam , after rigging a referendum . He repressed political opposition , arresting the famous writer Nguyn Tng Tam , who committed suicide while awaiting trial in jail . Dim also acted aggressively to remove Communist agents still remaining in the South . He formed the Cn Lao Nhn V Party , mixing Individualist philosophy with republican and capitalist elements , as well as being anti-Communist and pro-Catholic . Another controversial policy was the Strategic Hamlet Program , which aimed to build fortified villages to remove and lock out Communists . However , it was in some ways ineffective as many covert communists were already part of the population and visually indistinguishable . It became unpopular as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . In North Vietnam during the 1950s , political opposition groups were suppressed ; those publicly opposing the government were imprisoned in hard labor camps . Prisoners were abused and beaten atop of labor-intensive work forced upon them . Many died of exhaustion , starvation , illness ( who often died without any medical attention ) , or assault by prison guards . Many middle-class , intellectual Northerners had been lured into speaking out against Ho 's communist regime , and most of them were later imprisoned in gulags , or executed , known as the Nhn VnGiai Phm affair . The government launched a land reform program , which , according to Steven Rosefielde , was aimed at exterminating class enemies . Victims were chosen in an arbitrary manner , following a quota of four to five percent . Torture was used on a wide scale , so much so that by 1956 Ho Chi Minh became concerned , and had it banned . to 172,000 people perished in the campaigns against wealthy farmers and landowners .

A Northern democratic literary movement called Nhn vn-Giai phm ( from the names of the two magazines which started the movement , based in Hanoi ) occurred , in which it attempted to encourage the democratization of the North and the free expression of thought . Intellectuals were thus lured into criticizing the leadership so they could be arrested later , many of whom were sent to hard labor camps ( Gulags ) , following the model of Mao Tse-tung 's Hundred Flowers campaign in China . Freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and other basic civilian freedoms were soon revoked after the government 's attempt of destroying the literary movement . A puritan personality cult was also established around Ho Chi Minh , later extended nationwide after the Communist reunification of the Vietnam , and is reminiscent to other Communist nations like North Korea , and the Soviet Union . In 1960 , at the Third Party Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party , ostensibly renamed the Labor Party since 1951 , L Dun arrived from the South and strongly advocated the use of revolutionary warfare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish communism nationwide . Despite some elements in the Party opposing the use of force , L Dun won the seat of First Secretary of the Party . As H Ch Minh was aging , L Dun virtually took the helm of war from him . The first step of his war plan was coordinating a rural uprising in the South ( ng Khi ) and forming the Viet Cong or National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam ( NLF ) toward the end of 1960 . The figurehead leader of the Viet Cong was Nguyn Hu Th , a South Vietnamese lawyer , but the true leadership was the Communist Party hierarchy in South Vietnam . Arms , supplies , and troops came from North Vietnam into South Vietnam via a system of trails , named the Ho Chi Minh trail , that branched into Laos and Cambodia before entering South Vietnam . At first , most foreign aid for North Vietnam came from China , as L Dun distanced Vietnam from the revisionist policy of the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev . However , under Leonid Brezhnev , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided North Vietnam with heavy weapons , such as T-54 tanks , artillery , MIG fighter planes , surface-to-air missiles etc . Meanwhile , in South Vietnam , although Ng nh Dim personally was respected for his nationalism , political stability and policies triggering rapid economic growth , he ran a nepotistic and authoritarian government . Elections were routinely rigged and Dim favored of minority Roman Catholics on many issues , believing that Catholics were more trustworthy , more anti-communist and more impermeable to Viet Cong infiltration . His religious policies sparked protests from the Buddhist community after demonstrators were killed on Vesak , Buddha 's birthday , in 1963 when they were protesting a ban on the Buddhist flag . This incident sparked mass protests calling for religious equality . The most famous case was of Venerable Thch Qung c , who burned himself to death to protest . The images of this event made worldwide headlines and brought extreme embarrassment for Dim . The tension was not resolved , and on August 21 , the ARVN Special Forces loyal to his brother and chief adviser Ng nh Nhu and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds . In the United States , the Kennedy administration became worried that the problems of Dim 's government were undermining the US 's anti-Communist effort in Southeast Asia , and of Dim 's increasing resistance and non-cooperation with the American government . On November 1 , 1963 , with the planning and backing of the CIA and the Kennedy administration , South Vietnamese generals led by Dng Vn Minh engineered a coup d ' tat and overthrew Ng nh Dim , killing both him and his brother Nhu. ( ' ' see also Ng nh Cn ' ' ) Between 1963 and 1965 , South Vietnam was extremely unstable as no government could keep power for long . There were more coups , often more than one every year . The Communist-run Viet Cong expanded their operation and scored some significant military victories during this period . In 1965 , US President Lyndon Johnson sent troops to South Vietnam to secure the country and started to bomb North Vietnam , assuming that if South Vietnam fell to the Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with the domino theory . Other US allies , such as Australia , New Zealand , South Korea , Thailand , the Philippines , and Taiwan also sent troops to South Vietnam . Although the American-led troops succeeded in containing the advance of Communist forces , the presence of foreign troops , the widespread bombing over all of Vietnam , and the social vices that mushroomed around US bases upset the sense of national pride among many Vietnamese , North and South , causing some to become sympathetic to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong . In 1965 , Air Marshal Nguyn Cao K and General Nguyn Vn Thiu took power in a coup , and presided over a stable junta , and promised to hold elections under US pressure . In 1967 , South Vietnam managed to conduct a National Assembly and Presidential election with Lt. General Nguyn Vn Thiu being elected to the Presidency , bringing the government to some level of stability . However , in 1968 , the Viet Cong launched a massive and surprise Tt Offensive ( known in South Vietnam as Bin C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tn Cng v Ni Dy Tt Mu Thn ) , attacking almost all major cities in South Vietnam over the Vietnamese New Year ( Tt ) . The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese captured the city of Hu , after which many mass graves were found . Many of the executed victims had relations with the South Vietnamese government or the US , or part of social groups that were considered enemies to the Viet Cong , like Catholics , business owners and intellectuals ( Thm St Tt Mu Thn ) . Over the course of the year the Viet Cong forces were pushed out of all cities in South Vietnam and nearly decimated . In subsequent major offensives in later years , North Vietnamese regulars with artillery and tanks took over the fighting . In the months following the Tet Offensive , an American unit massacred civilian villagers , suspected to be sheltering Viet Cong guerillas , in the hamlet of My Lai in Central Vietnam , causing an uproar in protest around the world . In 1969 , H Ch Minh died , leaving wishes that his body be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for public display and built the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum on Ba nh Square in H Ni , in the style of Lenin 's Mausoleum in Moscow . Although the Tt Offensive was a catastrophic military defeat for the Vit Cng , it was a stunning political victory as it led many Americans to view the war as unwinnable . U.S. President Richard Nixon entered office with a pledge to end the war with honor . He normalized US relations with China in 1972 and entered into dtente with the USSR . Nixon thus forged a new strategy to deal with the Communist Bloc , taking advantage of the rift between China and the Soviet Union . A costly war in Vietnam begun to appear less effective for the cause of Communist containment . Nixon proposed Vietnamization of the war , with South Vietnamese troops taking charge of the fighting , yet still receiving American aid and , if necessary , air and naval support . The new strategy started to show some effects : in 1970 , troops from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campaign ) ; in 1971 , the ARVN made an incursion into Southern Laos to cut off the Ho Chi Minh trail in Operation Lam Son 719 , but the operation failed as most high positions captured by ARVN forces were recaptured by North Vietnamese artillery ; in 1972 , the ARVN successfully held the town of An Lc against massive attacks from North Vietnamese regulars and recaptured the town of Qung Tr near the demilitarised zone ( DMZ ) in the center of the country during the Easter Offensive . At the same time , Nixon was pressing both Hanoi and Saigon to sign the Paris Peace Agreement of 1973 , for American military forces to withdraw from Vietnam . The pressure on Hanoi materialized with the Christmas Bombings in 1972 . In South Vietnam , Nguyn Vn Thiu vocally opposed any accord with the Communists , but was threatened with withdrawal of American aid . Despite the peace treaty , the North violated the treaty and continued the war as had been envisioned by L Dun and the South still tried to recapture lost territories . In the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seen as losing a strong backer . Under U.S. President Gerald Ford , the Democratic-controlled Congress became less willing to provide military support to South Vietnam . In 1974 , South Vietnam also fought and lost the Battle of Hong Sa , in defending the islands against the invading Chinese over the control of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea . Neither North Vietnam nor the U.S. were involved . In early 1975 , North Vietnamese military led by General Vn Tin Dng launched a massive attack against the Central Highland province of Bun M Thut . South Vietnamese troops had anticipated attack against the neighboring province of Pleiku , and were caught off guard . President Nguyn Vn Thiu ordered the moving of all troops from the Central Highland to the coastal areas , as with shrinking American aid , South Vietnamese forces could not afford to spread too thin . However , due to lack of experience and logistics for such a large troop movement in such a short time , the whole South Vietnamese 2nd Corps got bogged down on narrow mountain roads , flooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambushes along the way . The South Vietnamese First Corps near the DMZ was cut off , received conflicting orders from Saigon on whether to fight or to retreat , and eventually collapsed . Many civilians tried to flee to Saigon via land , air , and sea routes , suffering massive casualties along the way . In early April 1975 , South Vietnam set up a last-ditch defense line at Xun Lc , under commander L Minh o . North Vietnamese troops failed to penetrate the line and had to make a detour , which the South Vietnamese failed to stop due to lack of troops . President Nguyn vn Thiu resigned . Power fell to Dng Vn Minh . Dng Vn Minh had led the coup against Dim in 1963 . By the mid-1970s , he had leaned toward the Third Party ( Thnh Phn Th Ba ) , South Vietnamese elites who favored dialogues and cooperation with the North . Communist infiltrators in the South tried to work out political deals to let Dng Vn Minh ascend to the Presidency , with the hope that he would prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although many South Vietnamese units were ready to defend Saigon , and the ARVN 4th Corps was still intact in the Mekong Delta , Dng Vn Minh ordered a surrender on April 30 , 1975 , sparing Saigon from destruction . Nevertheless , the reputation of the North Vietnamese army towards perceived traitors preceded them , and hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese fled the country by all means : airplanes , helicopters , ships , fishing boats , and barges . Most were picked up by the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the South China Sea or landed in Thailand . The seaborne refugees came to be known as boat people . In a famous case , a South Vietnamese pilot , with his wife and children aboard a small Cessna plane , landed safely without a tailhook on the aircraft carrier . This mass exodus of ( mostly South ) Vietnamese political refugees continued into the 1980s as refugees fled from persecution , political oppression and economic collapse caused by the new Communist regime . During this period , North Vietnam was a Communist state with a centralized command economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proletariat , a powerful propaganda machine that effectively rallied the people for the Party 's causes , a superb intelligence system that infiltrated South Vietnam ( spies such as Phm Ngc Tho climbed to high military government positions ) , and a severe suppression of political opposition .

Nevertheless , this iron grip , together with consistent support from the Soviet Union and China , gave North Vietnam a militaristic advantage over South Vietnam . North Vietnamese leadership also had a steely determination to fight , even when facing massive casualties and destruction at their end . The young North Vietnamese were idealistically and innocently patriotic , ready to give the ultimate sacrifice for the liberation of the South and the unification of the motherland . # Socialist Republic ( from 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring Offensive were killed or abducted on the road to Tuy Ha in 1975 .

Rummel estimates that slave labor in the New Economic Zones caused 50,000 deaths ( out of a total 1 million deported ) . The number of Vietnamese boat people who died is estimated between 200,000 and 400,000 , out of the 2.5 million that fled . There were also tens of thousands of suicides after the North Vietnamese take-over . In 1988 , Vietnam suffered a famine that afflicted millions . Many North Vietnamese soldiers and cadres began to realize that they had been indoctrinated into thinking that the South Vietnamese people were utterly poor and exploited by the imperialists and foreign capitalists who treated them like slaves , shackling , whipping and terrorizing them with dogs . Contradictory to what they were taught , they saw an abundance of food and consumer goods , fashionable clothes , plenty of books and music ; things that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed by Dng Thu Hng , a former northern Viet Cong fighter turned democracy activist and book author , who wrote of this in her book Paradise of the Blind . In 1976 , Vietnam was officially unified and renamed Socialist Republic of Vietnam ( SRVN ) , with its capital in H Ni . The Vietnamese Communist Party dropped its front name Labor Party and changed the title of First Secretary , a term used by China , to General Secretary , used by the Soviet Union , with L Dun as General Secretary . The Viet Cong was dissolved . The Party emphasized development of heavy industry and collectivization of agriculture . Over the next few years , private enterprises were seized by the government and their owners were often sent to the New Economic Zones -- a communist euphemism for a thick jungle -- to clear land . The farmers were coerced into state-controlled cooperatives . Transportation of food and goods between provinces was deemed illegal except by the government . Within a short period of time , Vietnam was hit with severe shortage of food and basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , was threatened with famine . During the mid-1980s , inflation reached triple figures . In foreign relations , the SRVN became increasingly aligned with the Soviet Union by joining the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ( Comecon ) , and signing a Friendship Pact , which was in fact a military alliance , with the Soviet Union . Tension between Vietnam and China mounted along with China 's rivalry with the Soviet Union and conflict erupted with Cambodia , China 's ally . Vietnam was also subject to trade embargoes by the U.S. and its allies . The SRVN government implemented a Stalinist dictatorship of the proletariat in the South as they did in the North . The network of security apparatus ( Cng An : literally Public Security , a communist term for the security apparatus ) controlled every aspect of people 's life . Censorship was strict and ultra-conservative , with most pre-1975 works in the fields of music , art , and literature being banned . All religions had to be re-organized into state-controlled churches . Any negative comments toward the Party , the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person the tag of Phn ng ( Reactionary ) , with consequences ranging from being harassed by police , expelled from school or workplace , to being sent to prison . Nevertheless , the Communist authority failed to suppress the black market , where food , consumer goods , and banned literature could be bought at high prices . The security apparatus also failed to stop a nationwide clandestine network of people trying to escape the country . In many cases , the security officers of some whole districts were bribed and even got involved in organizing the escape schemes . These living conditions resulted in an exodus of over a million Vietnamese secretly escaping the country either by sea or overland through Cambodia . For the people fleeing by sea , their wooden boats were often not seaworthy , were packed with people like sardines , and lacked sufficient food and water . Many were caught or shot at by the Vietnamese coast guards , many perished at sea due to boats sinking , capsizing in storms , starvation and thirst . Another major threat were the pirates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and murdered the boat people . In many cases , they massacred the whole boat . Sometimes the women were raped for days before being sold into prostitution . The people who crossed Cambodia faced equal dangers with mine fields , and the Khmer Rouge and Khmer Serei guerillas , who also robbed , raped , and killed the refugees . Some were successful in fleeing the region and landed in numbers in Malaysia , Indonesia , the Philippines , and Hong Kong , only to wind up in United Nations refugee camps . Some famous camps were Bidong in Malaysia , Galang in Indonesia , Bataan in the Philippines and Songkla in Thailand . Some managed to travel as far as northern Australia in crowded , open boats . All foreign missionaries were expelled from Vietnam , including the most famous Salesian priest , Servant of God Andrej Majcen ( 19071999 ) from Yugoslavia ( now Slovenia ) too ; he however remained great friend of Vietnamese peoples during whole life . While most refugees were resettled to other countries within five years , others languished in these camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could not find asylum were deported back to Vietnam . Communities of Vietnamese refugees arrived in the US , Canada , Australia , France , West Germany , and the UK . The refugees often sent relief packages packed with necessities , such as medicines and sanitary goods to their relatives in Vietnam to help them survive . Very few would send money as it would be exchanged far below market rates by the Vietnamese government . Despite the defeat of South Vietnam , there was no serious demobilization of the Vietnamese People 's Army , which remained one of Asia 's largest militaries at over one million troops , or sign that warfare was coming to an end anytime soon . Not only were Vietnamese soldiers highly experienced from decades of fighting , but also had acquired a large cache of captured US and South Vietnamese armaments . Vietnam soon found itself drawn into conflict with Cambodia , which had been ruled by the communist Khmer Rouge since 1975 .

As the Khmer Rogue were allies of Beijing , this further aggravated tensions and following border skirmishes , the VPA launched a full-scale armed invasion of Cambodia during the first week of 1979 . Given the extreme brutality and mass murders committed by the Khmer Rouge ( which had killed or starved at least three million Cambodians ) , the international community could only consider the Vietnamese invasion a positive development . This had the effect however of causing conflict with China and during a visit to the US in February , Deng Xiaoping stated that It may be necessary to teach Vietnam a lesson . A large Chinese force invaded the Vietnamese border area , but with China still suffering the effects of the Cultural Revolution , the People 's Liberation Army was seriously deficient in training , equipment , and communications .

Shortly afterwards , they withdrew with Beijing proclaiming that the aforementioned lesson had been taught as in any case , the fighting caused extensive destruction to Vietnam 's infrastructure along the border . The pro-Vietnamese People 's Republic of Kampuchea was created with Heng Samrin as Chairman . The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia had stopped the genocide of millions of Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge . Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge allied with non-Communist guerilla forces led by Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann to fight against the Vietnamese forces and the new Phnom Penh regime . Some high-ranking officials of the Heng Samrin regime in the early 1980s resisted Vietnamese control , resulting in a purge that removed Pen Sovan , Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Kampuchean People 's Revolutionary Party . The war lasted until 1989 when Vietnam withdrew its troops and handed the administration of Cambodia to the United Nations .

In 1980 , cosmonaut Phm Tun became the first Vietnamese and the first Asian to go into space , traveling on the Soviet Soyuz 37 to service the Salyut 6 space station . During the early 1980s , a number of overseas Vietnamese organizations were created with the aim of overthrowing the Vietnamese Communist government through armed struggle . Most groups attempted to infiltrate Vietnam but eventually were eliminated by Vietnamese security and armed forces . Overall , the first decade after reunification was not a happy time for the country . Nonstop warfare consumed large amounts of Vietnam 's resources , both financially and by depleting the labor force of young men . The country remained internationally isolated , having little contact with nations outside COMECON members , and faced with a huge , hostile neighbor to the north . Despite repeated overtures to the United States , attempts to reestablish diplomatic relation were hampered by the question of missing US soldiers from the war and President Ronald Reagan 's vocal hostility towards the country 's principle benefactor in Moscow . In a 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dong remarked Yes , we defeated the United States , but now we are a poor undeveloped nation and barely have enough to eat . Hence the saying that waging war is easy , but running a country is hard . Compounding all this was the complete failure of the Five Year Plan adopted in 1976 , as Vietnam remained one of the world 's poorest countries with a per-capita GDP of less than 300 USD and almost totally dependent on Soviet aid , which reached as much as 3 billion USD a year by 1982 . Moscow faced mounting pressure from its Warsaw Pact allies to reduce outlays to Vietnam . Soviet-Vietnamese relations were also harmed by the former 's wishes to have greater involvement in Vietnam 's economic development and increased access to military facilities .

More surprising was the removal of General Vo Nguyen Giap , considered a national hero , from the Politburo ( it was later speculated that he was removed by political rivals ) This rejuvenation campaign was nonetheless diminished by the fact that the country 's three most powerful individuals , Le Duan , Pham Van Dong , and President Truong Chinh , showed no sign of stepping down any time soon despite their combined age of 226 and clearly failing health ( all of them visited Moscow for medical treatment during 1982 ) .

However , Trng was expelled only five months later and replaced by Nguyen Van Linh , eight years his junior . Pham Van Dong retired as Premier in 1987 . Upon their accession , the country 's new leadership denounced their geriatric predecessors for utterly failing to improve the people 's living standards , check corruption , or instill a more flexible , non-dogmatic outlook on life . During the late 80s , Vietnam began tentative market reforms along the model then being adopted by China .
