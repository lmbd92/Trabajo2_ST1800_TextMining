@@31487514 Neuropathy target esterase also known as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 6 ( PNPLA6 ) is a neuropathy target esterase enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ' ' PNPLA6 ' ' gene . Neuropathy target esterase is a phospholipase that deacetylates intracellular phosphatidylcholine to produce glycerophosphocholine . It is thought to function in neurite outgrowth and process elongation during neuronal differentiation . The protein is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum in both neurons and non-neuronal cells . # Function # Neuropathy target esterase is an enzyme with phospholipase B activity : It sequentially hydrolyses both fatty acids from the major membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine , which generates water-soluble glycerophosphocholine . In cells of eukaryotes from yeast to humans , NTE is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is particularly abundant in neurons , the placenta , and the kidney . Loss of NTE activity results in abnormally elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine in brain and impairment of the constitutive secretory pathway in neurons . In kidney , the expression of neuropathy target esterase is regulated by TonEBP as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinical significance # Mutations in this gene result in autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia , and the protein is the target for neurodegeneration induced by organophosphorus compounds and chemical warfare agents . Recessively-inherited mutations in ' ' NTE ' ' that substantially reduce its catalytic activity cause a rare form of hereditary spastic paraplegia ( SPG39 ) , in which distal parts of long spinal axons degenerate leading to limb weakness and paralysis . Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy a paralysing syndrome with distal degeneration of long axons results from poisoning with neuropathic organophosphorus compounds that irreversibly inhibit NTE.
