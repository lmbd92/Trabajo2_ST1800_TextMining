@@285514 The Ashvamedha ( Sanskrit : ' ' avamedh ' ' ; horse sacrifice ) was one of the most important royal rituals of Vedic religion , described in detail in the Yajurveda ( TS 7.1-5 , VSM 22&amp;ndash ; 25 and the pertaining commentary in the Shatapatha Brahmana BM 13.1&amp;ndash ; 5 ) . The Rigveda does have descriptions of horse sacrifice , notably in hymns RV 1.162-163 ( which are themselves known as ' ' ' ' ) , but does not allude to the full ritual according to the Yajurveda . As per Brahma Vaivarta Purana ( 185.180 ) , On the next morning , the priests raise the queen from the place where she has spent the night with the horse . With the ' ' Dadhikra ' ' verse ( RV 4.39.6 , YV VSM 23.32 ) , a verse used as a purifier after obscene language .

The horse is dissected , and its flesh roasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personified concepts with utterances of ' ' svaha ' ' all-hail . The ' ' Ashvastuti ' ' or Eulogy of the Horse follows ( RV 1.162 , YV VSM 24.24&amp;ndash ; 45 ) , concluding with : : May this Steed bring us all-sustaining riches , wealth in good kine , good horses , manly offspring : Freedom from sin may Aditi vouchsafe us : the Steed with our oblations gain us lordship ! The priests performing the sacrifice were recompensed with a part of the booty won during the wandering of the horse . According to a commentator , the spoils from the east were given to the Hotar , while the Adhvaryu a maiden ( a daughter of the sacrificer ) and the sacrificer 's fourth wife . The Shatapatha Brahmana emphasizes the royal nature of the Ashvamedha : : Verily , the Asvamedha means royal sway : it is after royal sway that these strive who guard the horse . ( BM 13.1.6.3 trans . Eggeling 1900 ) It repeatedly states that the Asvamedha is everything ( BM 13.4.2.22 trans .

It is a bloody sacrifice in which the domestic animals are killed and non-domestic animals are set free . It ends with a further sacrifice of twenty one cows . Gifts are then given to the officers , culminating in the gift to the priests of the four wives of the king or their attendants . . The human sacrifice , the Purushamedha , followed a similar format , but included a man with the animals to be sacrificed . The price of the man was set at one thousand cows and a hundred horses . Like the horse , the man chosen for sacrifice was allowed to wander for a year . Once he had been killed , the queen lay with his corpse . The Ashvamedha celebrated the king as king of the whole world , not as king of a part of the world that constituted his kingdom . The stature of a king was not related to a particular part of the world that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse was considered a noble animal and was associated with the military class . When the Asvamedha has been performed in historical times , it has been more to demonstrate Vedic orthodoxy than for genuinely religious reasons . The Laws of Manu refer to the Ashvamedha ( V.53 ) : ' The man who offers a horse-sacrifice every day for a hundred years , and the man who does not eat meat , the two of them reap the same fruit of good deeds . ' # Known historical performances # Pusyamitra Sunga is said to have performed the Ashvamedha rite after he toppled Mauryan rule in 185 BC . A historically documented performance of the Ashvamedha is during the reign of Samudragupta I ( died 380 ) , the father of Chandragupta II . Special coins were minted to commemorate the Ashvamedha and the king took on the title of ' ' Maharajadhiraja ' ' after successful completion of the sacrifice .

In the Mahabharata , the sacrifice is performed by Yudhishtira ( Book 14 ) , his brothers guarding the horse as it roamed into neighbouring kingdoms . Arjuna defeats all challengers . The Mahabharata says that the Ashvamedha as performed by Yudhishtira adhered to the letter of the Vedic prescriptions . After the horse was cut into parts , Draupadi had to sit beside the parts of the horse . In the Ramayana , Rama 's father Dasharatha performs the Ashvamedha , which is described in the ' ' bala kanda ' ' ( book 1 ) of the poem . The Ramayana provides far more detail than the Mahabharata . The ritual take place for three days preceded by sage Rishyasringa and Vasista(1.14.41,42) . Again it is stated that the ritual was performed in strict compliance with Vedic prescriptions ( 1.14.10 ) . Dasaratha 's chief wife Kausalya circumambulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird . 1-14-34 . The fat of the sacrificed horse is then burnt in ritual fire and after that the remaining parts of the body with spoons made out of Plaksha tree branches(1.14.36,38-39) . At the conclusion of the ritual Dasharatha symbolically offers his other wives to the presiding priests , who return them in exchange for expensive gifts ( 1.14.35 ) . The four sides of the Yagna altar is also donated to priests who had done the ritual and it is exchanged by them for gold , silver , cows and other gifts(1.15.43-44) . In the Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata , the sacrifice is performed by King Vasu Uparichara . By the king 's decree , no animals were slain during the yagna , and the only offerings that were made were products of the wilderness . Some historians believe that the bala kanda and uttara kanda were latter interpolations to the authentic form of the Ramayana , due to references to Greek , Parthians and Sakas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Indo-European comparison # Many Indo-European branches show evidence for horse sacrifice , and comparative mythology suggests that they derive from a Proto-Indo-European ritual . The Ashvamedha is the clearest evidence preserved , but vestiges from Latin and Celtic traditions allow the reconstruction of a few common attributes . The Gaulish personal name ' ' Epomeduos ' ' is from ' ' *ek'wo-medhu- ' ' horse+mead , while ' ' ashvamedha ' ' is either from ' ' *ek'wo-mad-dho- ' ' horse+drunk or ' ' *ek'wo-mey-dho- ' ' horse+strength . The reconstructed myth involves the coupling of a king with a divine mare which produced the divine twins . Some scholars , including Edgar Polom , regard the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European ritual as unjustified due to the difference between the attested traditions ( EIEC s.v . ' ' Horse ' ' , p. 278 ) . # Vedanta and Puranas # The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad ( a mystical appendix to the Shatapatha Brahmana and likely the oldest of the Upanishads ) has a creation myth where ' ' ' ' Death takes the shape of a horse , and includes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became a horse ( ' ' ashva ' ' ) , because it swelled ( ' ' ashvat ' ' ) , and was fit for sacrifice ( ' ' medhya ' ' ) ; and this is why the horse-sacrifice is called Ashva-medha ... Therefore the sacrificers offered up the purified horse belonging to Prajapati , ( as dedicated ) to all the deities . Verily the shining sun ' ' ye tapati ' ' is the Asvamedha , and his body is the year ; Agni is the sacrificial fire ( ' ' arka ' ' ) , and these worlds are his bodies . These two are the sacrificial fire and the Asvamedha-sacrifice , and they are again one deity , viz. Death . ( BrUp 1.2.7. trans . Mller ) The Upanishads describe ascetic austerities as an inner Ashvamedha , as opposed to the outer royal ritual performed in the physical world , in keeping with the general tendency of Vedanta to move away from priestly ritual towards spiritual introspection ; verse 6 of the Avadhuta Upanishad has : : Through extreme devotion ' ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . That is the greatest sacrifice ' ' ' ' and the greatest meditation ' ' ' ' . According to the Brahma Vaivarta Purana ( 185.180 ) , the Ashvamedha is one of five rites forbidden in the Kali Yuga. # In Hindu revivalism # In the Arya Samaj reform movement of Dayananda Sarasvati , the Ashvamedha is considered an allegory or a ritual to get connected to the inner Sun ( Prana ) Dayananda in his ' ' Introduction to the commentary on the Vedas ' ' rejected the classical commentaries of the Vedas by Sayana , Mahidhara and Uvata as medieval corruptions opposed to the real meaning of the Vedas ( p. 443 ) in order to arrive at an entirely symbolic interpretation of the ritual : An empire is like a horse and the subjects like other inferior animals ( p. 448 ) .

This interpretation is apparently based on a verse from Shatapatha Brahmana . Following Dayananda , Arya Samaj disputes the very existence of the pre-Vedantic ritual ; thus Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati claims that : the word in the sense of the Horse Sacrifice does not occur in the Samhitas ... In the terms of cosmic analogy , ' ' ashva ' ' is the Sun . In respect to the ' ' adhyatma paksha ' ' , the ' ' Prajapati-Agni ' ' , or the ' ' Purusha ' ' , the Creator , is the ' ' Ashva ' ' ; He is the same as the Varuna , the Most Supreme . The word ' ' medha ' ' stands for homage ; it later on became synonymous with oblations in rituology , since oblations are offered , dedicated to the one whom we pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ' slaughter ' or ' sacrifice ' . ' ' The Critical and Cultural Study of the Shatapatha Brahmana by Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati ' ' , p. 415 ; 476 arguing that the animals listed as sacrificial victims are just as symbolic as the list of human victims listed in the Purushamedha. ( which is generally accepted as a purely symbolic sacrifice already in Rigvedic times ) . Other commentators accept the existence of the sacrifice but reject the notion that the queen lay down with the dead horse . Thus Subhash Kak in a blog posting suggests that the queen lay down with a toy horse rather than with the slaughtered stallion , due to presence of the word ' ' Ashvaka ' ' , similar to ' ' Shivaka ' ' meaning idol or image of Shiva All World Gayatri Pariwar since 1991 has organized performances of a modern version of the Ashvamedha where a statue is used in place of a real horse , according to Hinduism Today with a million participants in Chitrakoot , Madhya Pradesh on April 16 to 20 , 1994 .

According to him , no horse was actually to be slaughtered in the ritual as per the Yajurveda. # Reception # The earliest recorded criticism of the ritual comes from the Crvka , an atheistic school of Indian philosophy that assumed various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference . A quotation of the Crvka from Madhavacharya 's Sarva-Darsana-Sangraha states : Griffith ( 1899 ) omits verses VSM 23.20&amp;ndash ; 31 ( the ritual obscenities ) , protesting that they are not reproducible even in the semi-obscurity of a learned European language ( alluding to other instances where he renders explicit scenes in Latin rather than English ) . A. B. Keith 's 1914 translation also omits verses . This part of the ritual offended the Dalit reformer and framer of the Indian constitution B. R. Ambedkar and is frequently mentioned in his writings as an example of the perceived degradation of Brahmanical culture . While others such has Manohar L. Varadpande , praised the ritual as social occasions of great magnitude . Rick F.
