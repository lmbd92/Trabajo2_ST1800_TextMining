@@791514 The 1977 Atlantic hurricane season had the fewest tropical storms since the 1965 season . The season officially began on June 1 , and lasted until November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . The first tropical depression of the season developed on June 13 , 12 days after the start of the season , in the western Caribbean Sea . After a succession of three other tropical depressions , the first tropical storm of the season , Hurricane Anita , finally became a named storm on August 29 &amp;ndash ; the latest date since the satellite era began in the 1960s . Anita struck Mexico as a Category 5 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson hurricane wind scale , bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall . At least 25,000 people were left homeless and 11 fatalities were reported . In addition to Anita , another notable tropical cyclone of this season was Hurricane Babe . The storm caused coastal flooding in southeastern Louisiana , resulting in $10 million ( 1977 USD ) in damage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . In addition to Anita and Babe , five other tropical cyclones &amp;ndash ; hurricanes Clara , Dorothy , and Evelyn , as well as Tropical Storm Frieda and Tropical Depression Nine &amp;ndash ; left only minor impacts on land . Overall , the tropical cyclones of the season collectively caused 11 fatalities and at least $13 million in damage , excluding the remnants of Tropical Depression Nine , which led to 53 deaths and $203 million in losses due to flooding in the Southeastern United States , New Jersey , and New York .

Activity began several days later with the formation of a tropical depression on June 13 . Although 16 tropical depressions formed , it was a below average season because only 6 of them strengthened into tropical storms . In terms of named storms , this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane status . In addition , one tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status , which is Category 3 or higher on the SaffirSimpson hurricane wind scale . The inactivity was attributed to a El Nio that began developing in August . Three hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season , causing 11 deaths and $13 million in damage . The last storm of the season , Tropical Depression Thirteen , dissipated on November 7 , over three weeks before the official end of the season on November 30 . Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1977 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of a tropical depression on June 13 . Activity briefly halted , until two other tropical depression developed in the second half of July . A fourth tropical depression formed in early August . Later that month , Hurricane Anita developed on August 29 . As September is the climatological peak of hurricane season , it was the most active month . Five tropical cyclones developed , including two tropical depressions , and hurricanes Babe , Clara , and Dorothy . There were also five tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evelyn , and Tropical Storm Frieda . The final tropical cyclone of the season , Tropical Depression Nine , developed between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda on November 3 and dissipated by November 7 . The season 's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 25 , which was the lowest ACE value since 1946 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km/h ) or tropical storm strength . Subtropical storms are not included , therefore , the subtropical stage of Babe is omitted from the total ACE value . # Storms # # Hurricane Anita # A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on August 29 , while located about 230 miles ( 370 km ) south-southwest of New Orleans , Louisiana . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on August 30 . Later that day , the storm had intensified into a hurricane . Although intensification briefly slowed , rapid deepening occurred from September 1 to the following day , when Anita peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 175 mph ( 280 km/h ) . The storm weakened slightly to a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall near Soto la Marina , Tamaulipas . It rapidly weakened inland , decreasing to tropical depression intensity early on September 3 . However , Anita remained intact across Mexico and reached the eastern Pacific Ocean as a depression . Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone , the precursor to Anita dropped light rainfall in Florida . Gusty winds and storm surge effected Louisiana . At Grand Isle , storm tides 2 ft above normal resulted in hundreds of families being asked to evacuate . Numerous coastal highways in Texas , including portions of State Highway 87 , were closed due to above normal tides . Precipitation reached 4.97 in in Rio Grande City . In Mexico , the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall . The winds caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25,000 people left homeless . The roofs of most buildings were destroyed near the location of Anita 's landfall . The highest amount of precipitation observed during the storm was 15.2 in at Soto la Marina , Tamaulipas . Overall damage is unknown . **25;3221;div </div> # Hurricane Babe # The interaction of a tropical wave and a cold upper low pressure area developed into a subtropical depression in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 3 . It strengthened while gradually acquiring tropical characteristics and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Babe late on September 4 . The storm curved north-northeastward and by early on the following day , it was upgraded to a hurricane . Around that time , Babe peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 km/h ) . Early on September 5 , Babe made landfall near Cocodrie , Louisiana at the same intensity . Later that day , it weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression on September 6 . However , Babe continued to move northeastward and then east-northeastward across the Southeastern United States until dissipating early on September 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern United States . In Louisiana , precipitation peaked at 10.99 in near Lafayette . Flooding damage was primarily to crops , mainly sugar cane . Six tornadoes were spawned in Louisiana , including one near Hammond that severely damage a country store and knocked six wood-frame homes off their foundations . Damage from this tornado alone reached $2.5 million . In other states , Babe brought flash flooding along its path due to rainfall exceeding 7 in in Mississippi , northwestern Georgia , and western North Carolina . Overall , Babe caused about $13 million in damage , but no deaths . **25;3248;div </div> # Hurricane Clara # A convective cloud mass with a spiral band of gale-force winds , associated with the development of Hurricane Babe , moved across the Southeastern United States in early September . The system developed a circulation by late on September 4 , while tracking across southeastern Georgia . After a slight drop in barometric pressure and an increase in wind speeds , a tropical depression formed inland near Charleston , South Carolina at 1200 UTC on September 5 . The depression initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina on September 6 , it began to organize while accelerating just north of due east . At 0000 UTC on September 8 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Clara . The storm quickly strengthened , becoming a hurricane only 12 hours later . Strong wind shear caused Clara to weaken back to a tropical storm on September 9 . Thereafter , the storm executed a cyclonic loop near Bermuda . By late on September 10 , Clara accelerated northeastward and became extratropical at 1200 UTC on September 11 . In its early stages , the storm dropped light rainfall in the Southeastern United States , peaking at 3.53 in in Beaufort , South Carolina . Additionally , Clara produced 0.55 in of precipitation in Bermuda . The remnants reached Canada and produced winds of 62mph km/h in Antigonish , Nova Scotia , which knocked over campers , uprooted trees , damaged barns , and caused power outages in the area . **25;3275;div </div> # Hurricane Dorothy # A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began organizing five days later . On September 21 , the wave crossed the Windward Islands , bringing wind gusts of 69mph km/h to Guadeloupe and Martinique and rainfall of 5to8 in on several islands . Although it was a strong tropical wave , the system weakened significantly while crossing Hispaniola on September 23 . Tracking steadily northward , it developed into a tropical depression northeast of the Bahamas on September 26 . A reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Dorothy at 1200 UTC on September 27 . Shortly after becoming a tropical storm , Dorothy passed just south of Bermuda , though no damage was reported on the island . The storm quickly strengthened while tracking northeastward and strengthened into a hurricane at 1200 UTC on September 28 . By early on September 29 , Dorothy attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km/h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980mbar inHg . Later that day , Dorothy transitioned into an extratropical storm while located south of Cape Race , Newfoundland . On September 30 , the extratropical remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located in the northern Atlantic Ocean . **25;3302;div </div> # Hurricane Evelyn # A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on October 3 . The system tracked westward at an abnormally low altitude of 6N . However , because the Azores high pressure was abnormally weak , the system quickly curved northwestward . After a significant increase in convection , a tropical depression developed at 1800 UTC on October 13 , while located 400 mi south of Bermuda . A ship later reported gale force winds , prompting an upgrade of the depression to Tropical Storm Evelyn on October 14 . Early on the following day , a reconnaissance flight recorded winds of 83mph km/h , indicating that Evelyn became a hurricane . Later on October 15 , accelerated to the north-northeast and made landfall on Cape Breton Island , Nova Scotia with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km/h ) at 1200 UTC . Shortly after entering the Gulf of Saint Lawrence , Evelyn merged with a cold front at 1800 UTC on October 15 , near the tip of southeastern Newfoundland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amount of rainfall &amp;ndash ; 2.60 in . On Sable Island , Evelyn produced tropical storm force winds , reaching 52mph km/h . In both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland , the storm dropped light rainfall , rarely exceeding 1 in . However , in Newfoundland , some areas experienced tropical storm force winds , mainly between Stephenville and St. John 's . However , this may have been in combination with the cold front that Evelyn merged with . In addition , a ship near the southwestern tip of Newfoundland reported sustained winds of 78mph km/h . **25;3329;div </div> # Tropical Storm Frieda # A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on October 4 . The wave tracked uneventfully westward for about 10 days . On October 12 , the remnants of a cold front reached the northwestern Caribbean Sea . The wave began interacting with it and another cold front that entered the region by October 16 . Later that day , a reconnaissance aircraft reported a surface circulation near Swan Islands , Honduras Frieda continued to intensify until peaking with winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barometric pressure of 1005mbar inHg early on October 18 . Later that day , Frieda weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity . At 0000 UTC on October 19 , the storm made landfall near Belize City , Belize as a weak tropical depression . Frieda promptly dissipated . Belize City reported only minimal rainfall and light winds . Around that time , the storm passed south of Swan Island , where it produced 4.46 in in a 30 hour period . On Grand Cayman , 5.42 in of precipitation fell in 36 hours . # Tropical Depression Nine # A tropical depression formed between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda on November 3 . Initially , the depression moved northeastward , though on November 4 , a building high pressure area forced it to track north of due west . Eventually , an upper-level low situated over the Southern United States caused the depression to re-curve north-northwestward . Late on November 7 , the depression made landfall near Cape Lookout , North Carolina . By early on the following day , the depression degenerated into a low pressure area while located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mid-Atlantic and New England , before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while offshore of Maine on November 11 . Moisture from Tropical Depression Nine and a low pressure area that tracked across the Southeastern United States resulted in heavy rainfall over western North Carolina and western Virginia , with up to 11.63 in at Idlewild in the former . In North Carolina , flooding destroyed 384 homes , 382 mi of highways , and 12 dams . Flooding was considered the worst in Yancey County , where nearly every bridge was washed out . Sixteen counties in the western portions of the state were declared disaster areas . The depression also produced 5to9 in of rainfall in northern Georgia . Eighteen bridges were destroyed and twenty-seven others were damaged . In Virginia , 100 homes were destroyed by flooding , with about the same amount suffering major damage . Similar impact was reported in Tennessee . Strong winds and storm tides in New Jersey caused extensive damage . Overall , the flooding event caused 53 deaths , 39 in Georgia , and 1 in Tennessee . Damage totaled $203 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . # Other storms # In addition to the six named storm and Tropical Depression Nine , a total of nine other tropical depressions developed during the season . Later in June , a tropical depression formed in the west-central Gulf of Mexico on June 13 . It headed north-northwestward and made landfall in Texas by the following day . The system rapidly dissipated after moving inland . The third tropical depression of the season developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on July 17 . After tracking northward , the depression struck near Mobile , Alabama on July 18 . By the following day , it dissipated in central Mississippi . In late July , another depression developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on July 25 . No further strengthening occurred and by the following day , it dissipated north of the Yucatn Peninsula . A tropical depression developed near the west coast of Africa on August 1 . The system tracked westward for three days without intensifying and dissipated on August 4 . The next tropical depression formed well west-southwest of Cape Verde on September 17 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lesser Antilles about three days later . Tropical Depression Four developed in the Bay of Campeche on September 22 . However , the depression remained weak and made landfall near Tampico , Tamaulipas at around 1000 UTC on September 23 . Later that day , it dissipated while barely inland . By October 1 , another tropical depression formed east of the Lesser Antilles . It headed west-northwestward and dissipated on October 3 , before reaching the Windward Islands . Tropical Depression Six developed in the central Atlantic Ocean on October 2 . It briefly headed east-southeastward , before curving northwestward on October 4 . The system dissipated later that day . Another tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico east of the Texas and Mexico border on October 24 . It tracked northeastward without intensification and made landfall in southeast Louisiana on October 25 , while still a tropical depression . The system quickly weakened and dissipated over southern Mississippi later that day . # Storm names # The following names were used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1977 .
