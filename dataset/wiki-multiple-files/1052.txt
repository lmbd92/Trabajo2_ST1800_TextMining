@@5658514 The Society for Pentecostal Studies ( SPS ) is an American scholarly association of biblical scholars , theologians , and others who are members of Pentecostal churches or are involved in the Charismatic Renewal . It was founded in 1970 . The members of the Society consider themselves responsible for recording the history and developing the theology of these grassroots movements that have influenced Christianity worldwide . # Overview # SPS was first envisioned by three classical Pentecostals , Dr. William W. Menzies of the Assemblies of God , Dr. H. Vinson Synan of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church , and Dr. Horace Ward of the Church of God . The original requirement for membership was adherence to the statement of faith of the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America . However , because nontrinitarians and others were unable to sign the statement for doctrinal reasons , this requirement was eventually eliminated . The purpose of the Society , as defined on its website , is to provide a scholarly forum in which to interpret the Pentecostal movement as well as to stimulate , encourage , recognize , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the implications of Pentecostal theology in relation to other academic disciplines , seeking a Pentecostal world-and-life view ; and to support fully , to the extent appropriate for an academic society , the statement of purposes of the Pentecostal World Fellowship . The Society holds annual conferences . The organization , which began as a scholarly branch of classical Pentecostalism , is now ecumenical , with over 600 members from all major Christian denominations . For many years , the Society has hosted the meetings of the Roman Catholic/Pentecostal dialogue ( see Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity ) . # Past Presidents # * William W.
