Maltese cross of MLE **6;1084;br ( * cross-polarized microscopy ) Multi-Lamellar Emulsion ( MLE ) is an oil-in-water ( O/W ) emulsion showing multi-lamellar structure and an original technology developed by NeoPharm in South Korea . MLE is made with NeoPharm 's proprietary pseudoceramide PC-9S . Lamellar structure , also observed in stratum corneum , is defined as a thin plate or membrane of skin lipids . MLE shows multiple layers of this lamellar structure , and as a moisturizer , MLE offers long-lasting skin moisturizing effects through reinforcing the skin 's natural barrier function . Under cross polarized microscopy , skin lipids and MLE show the similar cross-like structure , termed as Maltese cross structure , and under electron microscopy , lamellar structures are observed . Stratum corneum , as the outermost layer of skin , is responsible for the various barrier function of skin and protects our body from external harmful things . Stratum corneum lipids are elaborately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role for skin 's barrier functions . Unlike the conventional moisturizers made with humectants or emollients , MLE can restore and improve the barrier function of skin , with its distinctive structural similarity to the native human skin 's lamellar structure . Restoring the skin barrier function can improve skin hydration and protect skin from external irritants . The efficacy of MLE on skin barrier was proven by several clinical studies performed in independent University Hospitals and reported in peer-reviewed academic journals , including Journal of Investigative Dermatology , one of the most renowned journals in the field of dermatology . Along with its therapeutic benefits , MLE also shows non-sticky textures , allowing quick absorption after application . As an O/W emulsion , MLE can be also used as a vehicle ( carrier ) for topical drugs . The multiple layer of MLE offers stabilization of active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) and efficient penetration of API into skin .
