@@35169514 Henry Nugent Bell ( 17921822 ) was an Irish genealogist . # Biography # He was the eldest son of George Bell , Esq. , of Belleview , County Fermanagh ( Inner Temple Admission Register ) . He followed the profession of a legal antiquary , and , in order to obtain a recognised status , entered himself at the Inner Temple , 17 Nov. 1818 . In the same year he acquired considerable distinction by his successful advocacy of the claim of Mr. Hastings to the long-dormant earldom of Huntingdon ; the estates , however , with the exception , it is said , of a mill in Yorkshire , had died from the title , and were legally invested in the Earl of Moira 's family . Bell published a detailed account of the proceedings in ' ' The Huntingdon Peerage ' ' , 4to , London , 1820 , pp. 413 , and the narrative of his various adventures , which are given at length , displays a suspicious luxuriance of imagination not altogether in keeping with what professed to be a grave genealogical treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affixed in 1821 , with a genealogical table and additional portraits . Bell was also employed by Mr. J. L. Crawford to further his claim to the titles and estates of Crawford and Lindsay , and , if we may credit the common report , received no less a sum than 5,036/. for prosecuting the suit . He was cut off before he could bring the matter to a decisive issue , and dying in- solvent , the unfortunate claimant 's money was in a great measure lost . According to Lady Anne Hamilton , Bell , with other minions , was delegated by Lord Sidmouth in 1819 to incite the starving people of Manchester against the ministry , and by their means the meeting of 16 Aug. was convoked which led to the Peterloo massacre . The circumstances attending his death as narrated in the journals of the day were somewhat tragic . An action to recover a sum of money advanced to him by an engraver named Cooke was tried on 18 Oct. 1822 , and a verdict passed against him ; on the same evening he died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
