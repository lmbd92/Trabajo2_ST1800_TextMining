@@256514 The tamaraw or Mindoro dwarf buffalo , with the scientific name ' ' Bubalus mindorensis ' ' , is a small , hoofed mammal belonging to the family Bovidae . It is endemic to the island of Mindoro in the Philippines , and is the only endemic Philippine bovine . It is believed , however , to have once also thrived on the larger island of Luzon . The tamaraw was originally found all over Mindoro , from sea level up to the mountains ( 2000 meters above sea level ) , but because of human habitation , hunting , and logging , it is now restricted to only a few remote grassy plains and is now an endangered species . Contrary to common belief and past classification , the tamaraw is not a subspecies of the local carabao , which is only slightly larger , or the common water buffalo . In contrast to the carabao , it has a number of distinguishing characteristics : it is slightly hairier , has light markings on its face , is not gregarious , and has shorter horns that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . # Anatomy and morphology # ' ' Bubalus mindorensis ' ' has the appearance of a typical member of its family . It has a compact , heavyset , bovine body , four legs that end in cloven hooves and a small , horned head at the end of a short neck . It is smaller and stockier compared to the Asiatic water buffalo ( ' ' Bubalus bubalis ' ' ) . There is little sexual dimorphism in the species although males are reported to have thicker necks . The tamaraw has an average shoulder height of 100-105cm in . The length of the body is 2.2m ft while the tail adds a further 60cm in . Reported weights have ranged from 180to300kg lb . Adults have a dark brown to grayish color and more hair than ' ' Bubalus bubalis ' ' . The limbs are short and stocky . White markings are seen in the hooves and the inner lower forelegs . These markings are similar to that of the anoa ' ' Bubalus depressicornis ' ' . The face is the same color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the species also has a pair of gray-white strips that begins from the inner corner of the eye to the horns . The nose and lips have black skin . The ears are 13.5 centimeters long from notch to tip with white markings on the insides . Both sexes grows short black horns in a V-shaped manner compared to C-shaped horns of ' ' Bubalus bubalis ' ' . The horns have flat surfaces and are triangular at their base . Due to the regular rubbing , the tamaraw 's horns have a worn outer surface but with rough inner sides . The horns are reported to be 35.5 to 51.0 centimeters long . However as anti-malarial medicine was developed , more people settled on the island . The increase in human activity has drastically reduced tamaraw population . By 1966 the tamaraw 's range was reduced to three areas : Mount Iglit , Mount Calavite and areas near the Sablayan Penal Settlement . By 2000 , their range was further reduced to only two areas : the Mounts Iglit-Baco National Park and Aruyan . Initial estimates of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at around 10,000 individuals in the early 1900s . Less than fifty years later in 1949 , the population had dwindled to around a thousand individuals . By 1953 , fewer than 250 animals were estimated to be alive . These population estimates continually grew smaller until the IUCN publication of their 1969 Red Data Book , where the tamaraw population was noted to be an alarmingly low 100 heads . This head count rose to 120 animals in 1975 . Current estimates place the wild tamaraw population from thirty to two hundred individuals . # Ecology and life history # As a rare , endemic mammal on a relatively secluded island , the ecology of the tamaraw is largely unknown . Individuals of the species are reclusive and shy away from humans . In addition , the small sizes of the species ' subpopulations , already spread thin throughout their fragmented range ( on 1986 , about 51 individuals are found in a 20 square kilometer area ) , make contact with any more than a solitary individual a rarity . # Habitat # ' ' Bubalus mindorensis ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thick brush , near open-canopied glades where it may graze and feed on grasses . Since human habitation and subsequent forest fragmentation of their home island of Mindoro , the habitat preferences of the tamaraw have somewhat expanded to lower-altitude grassy plains . Within their mountainous environment , tamaraws will usually be found not far from sources of water . # Trophic ecology # The tamaraw is a grazer that feeds on grasses and young bamboo shoots although it is known to prefer cogon and ' ' talahib ' ' ( ' ' Saccharum spontaneum ' ' ) . They are naturally diurnal , feeding during the daytime hours ; however , daytime human activities have recently forced select ' ' B. mindorensis ' ' individuals to be nocturnal to avoid human contact . # Life history # The tamaraw is known to live for about 20 years , with an estimated lifespan of about 25 . The adult female tamaraw gives birth to one offspring after a gestation period of about 300 days . There is an interbirth interval of two years , although one female has been sighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its mother before becoming independent . # Behavioral ecology # Unlike the closely related water buffalo , ' ' B. mindorensis ' ' is a solitary creature . Adults of the species do not occur in herds or smaller packs and are often encountered alone . Only juveniles exhibit the typical bovine herding behavior and clan hierarchy often seen in water buffalo . Males and females are known to associate all year round but this interaction lasts only a few hours . It has been suggested that this solitary behavior is an adaptation to its forest environment . Adult males are often solitary and apparently aggressive while adult females can be alone , accompanied by a bull , or three young of different ages . Similar to other bovines , the tamaraw wallows in mud pits . It has been suggested that this behavior is employed by the animals in order to avoid biting insects . Another distinct behavior in ' ' B. mindorensis ' ' is their fierceness . There are reports concerning their fierceness when cornered although most are unsubstantiated . Threat posture used by the bovine involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical position . This is accompanied with a lateral shaking of the head . # Evolutionary history # The presence of ' ' B. mindorensis ' ' on the island of Mindoro , coupled with the discovery of fossil bubalids in other islands around the archipelago indicates that the family was once widespread throughout the Philippines . Recent genetic analysis studies of the family members further strengthen this view . # Etymology and taxonomic history # The tamaraw was originally described as ' ' Anoa mindorensis ' ' by the French zoologist Pierre Marie Heude in 1888 . In 1958 , it was described as ' ' Anoa bubalis mindorensis ' ' , a subspecies of the then-water buffalo species ( ' ' Anoa bubalis ' ' ) . A little over a decade after , the tamaraw was elevated to species status as ' ' Anoa mindorensis ' ' in 1969 . The name ' ' tamaraw ' ' has other variants like ' ' tamarau ' ' , ' ' tamarou ' ' and ' ' tamarao ' ' . It has been suggested that the term ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a probable alternative name for the Banteng ( ' ' Bos javanicus ' ' ) . # Conservation # Being an entirely endemic and rare land mammal , ' ' Bubalus mindorensis ' ' stands as an extremely vulnerable species . Currently , it is classified as a critically endangered species and has been so since 2000 by the IUCN on its IUCN Red List of endangered species . Awareness of the conservation status of ' ' Bubalus mindorensis ' ' began way back in 1965 when it was classified as ' ' Status inadequately known ' ' by the IUCN . Enough data was gathered on the tamaraw population by 1986 , and the IUCN conservation monitoring center declared the species endangered . Throughout succeeding surveys conducted in 1988 , 1990 , 1994 and 1996 , the species remained listed on the Red List as ' ' endangered ' ' . The relisting of the species in 1996 fulfilled the IUCN criteria ' ' B1+2c ' ' and ' ' D1 ' ' . Criterion ' ' B1 ' ' indicated that the species ' range was less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than five independent locations . A noticed continuing decline in the population fulfilled sub-criterion ' ' 2c ' ' , given the condition of the population 's sole habitat . Criterion ' ' D1 ' ' essentially required that a population be composed of less than 250 mature individuals ; individual counts of the ' ' B. mindorensis ' ' population at the time figured significantly lower than this . In 2000 , the tamaraw was relisted on the Red List under the more severe ' ' C1 ' ' criteria . This was due to estimates that the population would decline by 20% in five years or within the timespan of two generations . Many factors have contributed to the decline of the tamaraw population . Over the course of the century , the increase of the human population on Mindoro has exposed the island 's sole tamaraw population to severe anthropogenic pressures . In the 1930s , the introduction of non-native cattle on the island caused a severe rinderpest epidemic among the tamaraw population then-numbering in the thousands . Hunting of tamaraws for food and sustenance has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most major factor threatening survival of ' ' B. mindorensis ' ' is habitat loss due to infrastructure development , logging and agriculture . These factors reduced the population of thousands during the early 1900s to less than 300 individuals in 2007 . Due to the decline of the ' ' B. mindorensis ' ' population , various Philippine laws and organizations have been created towards the conservation of the species . In 1936 , Commonwealth Act No. 73 was enacted by the then-Philippine Commonwealth . The act specifically prohibited killing , hunting and even merely wounding tamaraws , with an exception noted for self-defense ( if one were to be attacked by an agitated individual ) or for scientific purposes . The penalties were harsh enough to include a hefty fine and imprisonment . In 1979 , an executive order was signed creating a committee specifically geared towards the conservation of the tamaraw . The tamaraw was referred to as a source of national pride in the said E.O . The Tamaraw Conservation Project was also established in 1979 . The organization has successfully bred a tamaraw , nicknamed Kali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act 9147 , or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act was enacted to protect the tamaraw and other endemic species from hunting and sale . During the 1970s , a gene pool was established to preserve the tamaraw 's numbers . However , the project was not successful as only one offspring , named Kali , was produced . As of 2011 , Kali is the only surviving animal in the gene pooling project . The project was also not improved as the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau shown that the tamaraws were already breeding in the wild . Cloning was not implemented for conservation as the Department of Environment and Natural Resource argued that such measures would diminish the genetic diversity of the species . A small subpopulation of tamaraw has been found within the confines of the Mt . Iglit Game Refuge and Bird Sanctuary on the same island of Mindoro . As of May 2007 , ' ' Bubalus mindorensis ' ' is on ' ' Appendix I ' ' of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species where it has been since the species was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the listing , CITES recognizes the species as critically endangered and threatened with extinction . Thus , international commercial trade in the species or any derivatives of which , such as the meat , horns or flesh is considered illegal . While commercial trade in the species is prohibited , exchange for non-commercial reasons such as scientific research is allowed . # Importance to humans # # Economical and commercial value # While not as heavily exploited as other large , endangered mammals , the tamaraw population on Mindoro was subject to some harvesting pressure from subsistence hunters before conservation efforts were spurred towards the latter half of the 20th century . The IUCN has described this as still ongoing in their 2006 Red List report . # In Philippine culture # Though the national animal of the Philippines is the carabao , In the 1970s Toyota Motors , through the defunct local company Delta Motors , built the Tamaraw AUV ( Asian Utility Vehicle ) . Because of its ruggedness and simplicity of design , some examples still survive to this day , copied by multinational companies Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers to this day . Because it is an Asian Utility Vehicle , it shares its design with the Kijang , the Indonesian version . Automobile maker Toyota once held a franchise in the Philippine Basketball Association , naming its team the Toyota Tamaraws ( see below ) . During the wake of the Asian utility popularity in the 1990s , Toyota Motors Philippines released an Asian Utility Vehicle ) called Tamaraw FX in the Philippines , an evolution of the Tamaraw AUV . It was widely patronized by taxi operators and was immediately turned into a staple mode of transportation much like a cross of the taxi and the jeepney . The FX eventually evolved into the Revo . The tamaraw is also the mascot of the varsity teams of the Far Eastern University ( FEU Tamaraws ) in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines , and of the Toyota Tamaraws of the Philippine Basketball Association . The Tamaraw Falls in Barangay Villaflor , Puerto Galera were also named after the bovine .
