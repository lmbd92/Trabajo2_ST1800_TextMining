@@14725514 Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) also known as ALK tyrosine kinase receptor or CD246 ( cluster of differentiation 246 ) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ' ' ALK ' ' gene . # Function # ALK plays an important role in the development of the brain and exerts its effects on specific neurons in the nervous system . The deduced amino acid sequences reveal that ALK is a novel receptor tyrosine kinase having a putative transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain . These sequences are absent in the product of the transforming NPM-ALK gene . ALK shows the greatest sequence similarity to LTK ( leukocyte tyrosine kinase ) . # Pathology # The ALK gene can be oncogenic in three ways by forming a fusion gene with any of several other genes , by gaining additional gene copies or with mutations of the actual DNA code for the gene itself . # Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma # The 2 ; 5 chromosomal translocation is associated with approximately 60% anaplastic large-cell lymphomas ( ALCLs ) . The translocation creates a fusion gene consisting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleophosmin ( NPM ) gene : the 3 ' half of ALK , derived from chromosome 2 and coding for the catalytic domain , is fused to the 5 ' portion of NPM from chromosome 5 . The product of the NPM-ALK fusion gene is oncogenic . In a smaller fraction of ALCL patients , the 3 ' half of ALK is fused to the 5 ' sequence of TPM3 gene , encoding for tropomyosin 3 . In rare cases , ALK is fused to other 5 ' fusion partners , such as TFG , ATIC , CLTC1 , TPM4 , MSN , ALO17 , MYH9. # Adenocarcinoma of the lung # The EML4-ALK fusion gene is responsible for approximately 3-5% of non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC) . The vast majority of cases are adenocarcinomas . The standard test used to detect this gene in tumor samples is fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) by a US FDA approved kit . Recently Roche Ventana has got the approval of Chinese FDA and European FDA to test mutation by IHC . Other techniques like reverse-transcriptase PCR ( RT-PCR ) can also be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recommended . ALK lung cancers are found in patients of all ages , although on average these patients may be somewhat younger . ALK lung cancers are more common in light cigarette smokers or nonsmokers , but a significant number of patients with this disease are current or former cigarette smokers . EML4-ALK-rearrangement in NSCLC is exclusive and not found in EGFR- or KRAS-mutated tumors # Gene rearrangements and overexpression in other tumours # *Familial cases of neuroblastoma *Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor * Adult and pediatric renal cell carcinomas *Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma * Breast cancer , notably the inflammatory subtype * Colonic adenocarcinoma * Glioblastoma multiforme * Anaplastic thyroid cancer # ALK inhibitors # Xalkori ( crizotinib ) , produced by Pfizer , was approved by the FDA for treatment of late stage lung cancer on August 26 , 2011 . Early results of an initial Phase I trial with 82 patients with ALK induced lung cancer showed an overall response rate of 57% , a disease control rate at 8 weeks of 87% and progression free survival at 6 months of 72%.
