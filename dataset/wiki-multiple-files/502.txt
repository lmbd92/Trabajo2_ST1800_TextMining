@@1901514 Philip K. Dick sold approximately fifteen short stories himself before becoming a client of the Scott Meredith Literary Agency . Roog was his first sale but not his first published story . # Story # Roog tells the story from the point of view of a dog named Boris , who observes his master 's carefully stored food in containers outside of their house day after day . Unbeknownst to the dog , these are the human 's trash cans for garbage . The dog is later horrified to witness some food being ' stolen ' by garbage men who the dog knows are predatory carnivores from another planet . The dog comes to know these beings as ' Roogs ' , and tries to warn his master of each ' theft ' with cries of ' Roog ! ' ' Roog ! ' . The humans , unable to comprehend the hound 's message think the dog is just being rowdy . Thus they attribute the sound the dog makes to be the sound that all dogs make when they are excited : ' Roog ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being somewhat distraught , barking ROOG ! very loudly at the garbagemen before they make off once more with trash in their garbage truck . # Publication # Roog was written in November 1951 and appeared in ' ' The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction ' ' November 1953 without illustration . During this time Dick worked in a record store . In an essay prefacing a collection of his short stories published in 1978 , Dick recalled the story 's gestation , as well as discussing its plot , its general themes and his reaction at the time . Dick relates that he contacted Anthony Boucher , a sci-fi/fantasy publisher , editor and fellow writer whom Dick recalls as a kind friend . Dick wrote , ' ' Without Boucher 's help I 'd still be in the record business . I mean that very seriously . ' ' As a young man , Dick was very pleased with the publication , and wondered if he could quit his job at a record store and work full-time as an author , while the older Dick ( 27 years on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s original publication , Boucher attempted to get it published once more , in a sci-fi anthology being compiled by a person Dick refers to as Ms. J.M. ( Judith Merrill ) . However , she disliked the story , finding it obscure and hard to understand . She also criticized Dick 's description of the garbagemen as inaccurate , apparently unable to see that the description is from the protagonist dog 's perspective . Despite Dick explaining the story in a letter to J.M. regarding the themes of the work , she rejected the story . Anthony Boucher , however , proceeded to publish it , and it remains in print today , at one time even appearing in a high school literature textbook . # Trivia # * The dog in Roog , Boris , was based upon a real dog called Snooper , who belonged to a neighbor of Dick . Snooper became very alarmed every time the garbagemen arrived to pick up trash , and this inspired Dick to write the short story . * Dick regarded Roog as quite a serious story , despite its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick ' ' that Roog tells of fear , it tells of loyalty and of obscure menace . # References #
