@@30991514 George Faulkner ( 1790 ? &amp;ndash ; 1862 ) was the supposed originator of the foundation of Owens College , Manchester . Faulkner was born about 1790 in Oldham Street , Manchester , in which town his life was spent . In 1812 he entered into partnership in a well-established firm of silk , cotton , and linen manufacturers , which still , though no longer under his name , continues to prosper . For a time its business included a fine-spinning mill , in which Faulkner 's intimate friend , John Owens , was one of his partners . At some date before Owens 's death , which happened in 1846 he is said to have informed Faulkner that he had made his will , in which he had left all his property to his friend . Faulkner , the story continues , refused point-blank to accept another fortune in addition to his own . Owens 's irritation at this singular conduct , however , ceased after a few days , when Faulkner suggested to him the plan of leaving the bulk of his wealth for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconditioned by religious tests . According to a paper ascribed to the late Professor Henry Rogers Faulkner was himself indebted for the original suggestion of his generous conception to Samuel Fletcher , a public-spirited and philanthropic Manchester merchant , who , unlike Faulkner , was a nonconformist . In any case the advice was taken , and when in 1851 Owens College was actually called into life at Manchester , Faulkner was elected the first chairman of its trustees . He filled this post efficiently till August 1858 , taking repeated opportunities of supplementing his friend 's munificence by liberal benefactions of his own . He died 21 February 1862 , leaving behind him a justly honoured name .
