@@2174514 In mathematics , a Sylvester matrix is a matrix associated to two univariate polynomials with coefficients in a field or a commutative ring . The entries of the Sylvester matrix of two polynomials are coefficients of the polynomials . The determinant of the Sylvester matrix of two polynomials is their resultant , which is zero when the two polynomials have a common root ( in case of coefficients in a field ) or a non-constant common divisor ( in case of coefficients in an integral domain ) . Sylvester matrix is named after James Joseph Sylvester . # Definition # Formally , let ' ' p ' ' and ' ' q ' ' be two nonzero polynomials , respectively of degree ' ' m ' ' and ' ' n ' ' . Thus : : <math> p(z)=p0+p1 z+p2 z2+cdots+pm zm , ; q(z)=q0+q1 z+q2 z2+cdots+qn zn . </math> The Sylvester matrix associated to ' ' p ' ' and ' ' q ' ' is then the <math> ( n+m ) times(n+m) </math> matrix obtained as follows : * the first row is : : <math> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; 0 &amp; cdots &amp; 0 endpmatrix. </math> * the second row is the first row , shifted one column to the right ; the first element of the row is zero . * the following ' ' n ' ' &amp;minus ; 2 rows are obtained the same way , still filling the first column with a zero . * the ( ' ' n ' ' + 1 ) th row is : : <math> beginpmatrix qn &amp; qn-1 &amp; cdots &amp; q1 &amp; q0 &amp; 0 &amp; cdots &amp; 0 endpmatrix. </math> * the following rows are obtained the same way as before . Thus , if ' ' m ' ' = 4 and ' ' n ' ' = 3 , the matrix is : : <math> Sp , q=beginpmatrix p4 &amp; p3 &amp; p2 &amp; p1 &amp; p0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 0 &amp; p4 &amp; p3 &amp; p2 &amp; p1 &amp; p0 &amp; 0 0 &amp; 0 &amp; p4 &amp; p3 &amp; p2 &amp; p1 &amp; p0 q3 &amp; q2 &amp; q1 &amp; q0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 0 &amp; q3 &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; 0 &amp; q3 &amp; q2 &amp; q1 &amp; q0 &amp; 0 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; q3 &amp; q2 &amp; q1 &amp; q0 endpmatrix. </math> # Applications # These matrices are used in commutative algebra , e.g. to test if two polynomials have a ( non constant ) common factor . In such a case , the determinant of the associated Sylvester matrix ( which is named the resultant of the two polynomials ) equals zero . The converse is also true . The solutions of the simultaneous linear equations : <math> Sp , **36;24252;TOOLONG = beginpmatrix00endpmatrix </math> where <math> x </math> is a vector of size <math> n </math> and <math> y </math> has size <math> m </math> , comprise the coefficient vectors of those and only those pairs <math> x , y </math> of polynomials ( of degrees <math> n-1 </math> and <math> m-1 </math> , respectively ) which fulfill : <math> x cdot p + y cdot q = 0 </math> ( where polynomial multiplication and addition is used in this last line ) . This means the kernel of the transposed Sylvester matrix gives all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and <math> deg y **15;24307; . Consequently the rank of the Sylvester matrix determines the degree of the greatest common divisor of ' ' p ' ' and ' ' q ' ' : : <math> deg ( gcd ( p , q ) = m+n-mathrmrankSp , q </math> Moreover , the coefficients of this greatest common divisor may be expressed as determinants of submatrices of the Sylvester matrix ( see Subresultant ) .
