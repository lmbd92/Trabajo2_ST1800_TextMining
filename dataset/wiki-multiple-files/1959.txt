@@14951514 PROPAGANDA is a large collection of GPL-licensed seamless desktop backgrounds included in various Linux distributions , and available via free download over the web . While no longer being produced or even officially hosted online , the collection consisted of approximately 15 volumes of largely abstract and surreal art , numbering over 1,000 images in total . Created in GIMP by Bowie J. Poag , the images were meant to attract users to the platform by virtue of the art having been 100% Linux-generated . The style of the images produced by Poag were unusual in terms of their geometric qualities . Appearing to repeat seamlessly along all four edges , PROPAGANDA images became attractive for use in 3D modeling , and particularly for use as desktop wallpaper , in that limitations in graphics hardware at the time often prevented users from using full screen 24-bit images . Using smaller , tileable images for desktop backgrounds helped keep memory utilization to a minimum , while still allowing early Linux desktops to be visually appealing . After ten months , Poag turned control of the project over to Naru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Technology . Although Sundar would subsequently release two additional volumes , Poag terminated the project in April 2000 citing a lack of activity by Sundar , and a falling out with Chris DiBona , a manager of community projects at VA Linux Systems , who provided hosting space for his project . As a side source of amusement , PROPAGANDA 's website featured a satirical storyline that John F. Kennedy had faked his own assassination in 1963 , and had placed himself into cryogenic suspension until the time was right to lead the charge against Microsoft , and help the Linux movement gain footing . While not greatly influential , Poag 's work with PROPAGANDA led many to develop an interest in Linux as a platform during its formative early years . The Propaganda site was formerly officially hosted at <nowiki> http : **26;4019;TOOLONG </nowiki> and then <nowiki> http : //propaganda.themes.org </nowiki> </tt> before going offline . # References # <references/>
