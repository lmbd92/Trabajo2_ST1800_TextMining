@@536514 ' ' The Adventure of the Deptford Horror ' ' is a Sherlock Holmes story by Adrian Conan Doyle . The story was published in the 1954 collection , ' ' The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes ' ' . Holmes and Watson are called to a house in Deptford , due to the concerns of a young woman about her safety . Several of her relatives have died in the past few years of heart attacks . A relative who trains canaries also lives in the house . Holmes is not able to detect anything amiss until he and Watson are en route home , but he suddenly solves the mystery and returns to Deptford to save the life of the young woman from a death by heart failure . # For a time , we sat in silence . Our cab had reached the beginnings of the City and I was gazing out of the window , my fingers drumming idly on the half&amp;ndash ; lowered pane , which was already befogged with moisture , when my thoughts were recalled by a sharp ejaculation from my companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # The glass , he muttered . # # Over the clouded surface there now lay an intricate tracery of whorls and lines where my finger had wandered aimlessly . # # Holmes clapped his hand to his brow and , throwing open the other window , he shouted an order to the cabby . # This apocryphal story was inspired by the mention in The Adventure of Black Peter of Holmes 's arrest of Wilson , the notorious canary-trainer , which removed a plague-spot from the East-End of London . In this story , Wilson is not arrested , but this discrepancy is explained as an error due to Dr Watson .
