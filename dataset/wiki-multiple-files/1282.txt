@@7586514 Michael Thonet ( 2 July 1796 -- 3 March 1871 ) was a German-Austrian cabinet maker . Thonet was the son of master tanner Franz Anton Thonet of Boppard . Following a carpenter 's apprenticeship , Thonet set himself up as an independent cabinetmaker in 1819 . A year later , he married Anna Grahs , with whom he had seven sons and six daughters . Only five of the sons , however , survived early childhood . In the 1830s , Thonet began trying to make furniture out of glued and bent wooden slats . His first success was the ' ' Bopparder Schichtholzstuhl ' ' ( Boppard layerwood chair ) in 1836 . Thonet gained substantial independence by acquiring the ' ' Michelsmhle ' ' , the glue factory that made the glue for this process , in 1837 . However , his attempts to patent the technology failed in Germany ( 1840 ) as well as in Great Britain , France and Russia ( 1841 ) . Thonet 's essential breakthrough was his success in having light , strong wood bent into curved , graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled him to design entirely novel , elegant , lightweight , durable and comfortable furniture , which appealed strongly to fashion - a complete departure from the heavy , carved designs of the past - and whose aesthetic and functional appeal remains to this day . At the Koblenz trade fair of 1841 , Thonet met Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich , who was enthusiastic about Thonet 's furniture and invited him to the Vienna court . In the next year , Thonet was able to present his furniture , and his chairs in particular , to the Imperial Family . As the Boppard establishment got into financial difficulties , Thonet sold it and emigrated to Vienna with his family . There , he worked with his sons on the interior decoration of the Palais Liechtenstein for the Carl Leistler establishment . In 1849 he again founded an establishment of his own , the ' ' Gebrder Thonet ' ' . In 1850 he produced his ' ' Nr 1 ' ' chair .

At the next World 's Fair in Paris 1855 , he was awarded the silver medal as he continued to improve his production methods . In 1856 he was able to open up a new factory in Koryany , Moravia . Its extensive beech woods were of great significance to his enterprise . The 1859 chair ' ' Nr. 14 ' ' - better known as ' ' Konsumstuhl Nr. 14 ' ' , coffee shop chair no. 14 - is still called the chair of chairs with some 50 million produced up until 1930 . It yielded a gold medal for Thonet 's enterprise at the 1867 Paris World 's Fair . As Michael Thonet died 1871 in Vienna , the ' ' Fa .
