Offham has a Quintain on the village green that was reported in medieval times for use in jousting . It is reputed to be the last English quintain in its original position , though it was removed for safe keeping during the Second World War . The village gets its name from Offa , the name of a Saxon landowner , and ham , a village or homestead . # History # The village has been occupied since Roman times , and the major Roman road from London to the Weald ran through the parish . Offham grew in prominence in the early ninth century under the Saxons . Jack Straw , the rebel during the reign of Richard II , is said to have been born at Pepingstraw Manor in the parish . # Quintain # The village is famed for its medieval quintain which stands on the green , believed to be the last remaining example in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in height with a freely-rotating arm on the top . One end of the arm is flat ( the eye ) , with the other used to attach heavy objects such as a leather pack . In a sport dating back to perhaps Roman times , a horseman would ride at the quintain at full pace with his lance extended to strike the flat end . Should the horseman not be riding sufficiently quickly , the arm would swing round and the heavy object knock him off his horse . # Ragstone # The village 's houses are predominantly constructed from ragstone , Kent 's most celebrated building stone . The stone has been mined in the parish since Roman times , with its hardness and durability making it a popular choice for fortifications in London and the south east . # Church # The first church in the parish was founded by the Saxon lord of the manor who built a private chapel in the early ninth century .

Built in the sixteenth century , the pub was originally two cottages , later owned by a saddler and harness maker who ran his business there until granted a license in 1680 .
