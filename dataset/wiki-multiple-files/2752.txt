@@24031514 LIFT Productions ( an acronym for Louisiana Institute of Film Technology ) was the first concerted private sector effort to combat Runaway production of film and television from the United States . In the 1990s the U.S. market lost over 100,000 production-related jobs , as motion picture and television programming increasingly became manufactured offshore . The outflow of work was in large part due to lucrative incentives offered by Canada , its provinces , and European Union members . In 2002 , at the urging of LIFT founders Malcolm Petal and John J Anderson , Louisiana passed a first-in-the-nation incentive program to compete directly with Canada . LIFT quickly leveraged those incentives to become one of the largest global manufacturers of made-for-television movies , low-budget feature films , music videos , and commercials . During its first five years of operation , LIFT was responsible for well over a billion dollars in production . By 2007 LIFT had spread throughout the State of Louisiana , as well as opening satellite Production Houses in Arizona and Connecticut . It had also broken ground on a $200,000,000 production complex in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau of Investigation agents raided LIFT 's offices , making sweeping accusations of fraud , money laundering , and tax evasion , valued at tens of millions of dollars . Despite the sensational allegations , the investigation petered out , officially closing in 2009 without uncovering any crimes , fraud or abuse at LIFT . CEO and Founder Malcolm Petal pled guilty in an unrelated bribery case . By that time , though , LIFT was a defunct organization . Its creditors continue to sue the State of Louisiana which refuses to honor tax incentives promised to LIFT , despite the fact that LIFT was cleared of any wrongdoing . # Early days # LIFT was a Production House formed by New Orleans attorney Malcolm Petal , and Producer John J Anderson . Their stated goal was to create a production infrastructure in Louisiana to compete with Los Angeles and New York . Throughout 2001 and 2002 the founders lobbied the Louisiana legislature to pass a production incentive modeled after Canada 's . The duo testified that Louisiana could become immediately competitive with much larger markets by recruiting U.S.-based productions back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive packages proposed by the LIFT founders on June 1 , 2002 . That same month LIFT officially opened its doors . During its early days LIFT concentrated primarily on music videos and commercials . Through its partnership with HSI Productions of California , LIFT produced a continuous stream of videos for a wide array of artists , including Mariah Carey , Jessica Simpson and LeAnn Rimes , as well as several national ad campaigns , including memorable spots for Lincoln and Payless Shoes . The tax credit program was widely recognized and hailed for its generosity - applying to music videos and commercials , as well as films and television , and also because there was no ceiling on how much credit can be accrued per production or per year . Three separate sets of production initiatives - a sales tax exemption , a labor tax credit encouraging productions to hire Louisiana labor and an investor tax credit that offered credit on as much as 15% on overall production costs . Petal explained that Without an incentive program it 's almost impossible to finance independent films and television movies .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle , back to the United States , this Louisiana incentive . n # Expanding business # LIFT had initially made low-budget feature films for limited theatrical release , like the cult classics Evil Remains and Freshman Orientation . However , in 2004 it expanded aggressively into the movie-of-the-week market producing dozens of films for Lifetime , CBS , and A&amp;E , including Christopher Reeve 's last picture , The Brooke Ellison Story , and the critically acclaimed mini-series Elvis , which earned Emmy nominations for the LIFT Founders . By the end of 2004 , LIFT had over 500 employees on payroll and had entered into long-term production and distribution contracts with independent powerhouse Lions ' Gate Entertainment . The partnership gained immediate box-office success with major releases , such as the comedy-classic Waiting .. , and critical acclaim with art-house offerings such as Bug starring Ashley Judd , which earned legendary director Billy Friedkin the coveted Director 's Award at the Cannes Film Festival . That year , LIFT had produced almost $75,000,000 in locally-financed production and was on track to double that in 2005 with more than 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its distribution outlets , releasing Mr. Brooks , starring Kevin Kostner , through MGM , and Factory Girl , starring Sienna Miller through the Weinstein Company . While in 2001 , movie production in Louisiana had an impact of just $30 million , by 2003 , estimates were in excess of $100 million . According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the motion picture industry in Louisiana grew by 22% per year between 2001 and 2007 with wages increasing 8.2% per year during that same period . A report released by the Economic Research Associates for Louisiana Department of Economic Development in 2007 found that the industry supported 6,230 jobs in Louisiana ( 3,310 directly and 2,920 indirectly ) , generated $203.7 million , and an average income of $32,700 per job . The ... $429.2 million of direct in-state spending for 2007 amounted to $763 million of economic benefit to Louisiana , when things like rents , royalties , profits , dividends , property taxes and various indirect benefits are factored in .

Budgets for these totalled over $100 million . Housing , production crews , and new set locations were all in place about a week after the hurricane hit . When Hurricane Katrina hit , most movie studios abandoned Louisiana , citing the poor infrastructure , dangerous weather , and inability to find insurance . However , LIFT managed to relocate all its Louisiana productions in other parts of the State , including opening a major production center in Shreveport in the far North of the State . L.I.F.T . offered all of its Louisiana workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stipends to establish an expansion office in North Louisiana ( $1.5 million aid package ) . .. All 500 workers on L.I.F.T.s payroll continue to receive paychecks without interruption despite closed banks and strained communications . As Petal stated at LIFT 's opening of its Shreveport facility , Louisiana 's incentive program has given it the opportunity to be the hub of the international Production industry in the 21st Century , but that only can take place if it is a statewide effort . Having an anchor for the industry , along the Northern I-20 corridor in Shreveport , is a crucial step in that journey . Today Shreveport is one of the most active Production locales in the United States . Thus , Katrina proved to be a significant growth opportunity for LIFT , which survived the disruption through a massive ground effort to move workers and equipment throughout the State . All of LIFTs productions were up and running again in less than a week , while most of the State was still shut down and reeling from the subsequent blast of Hurricane Rita . LIFT also kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their families a generous relief package , which included 8 months or more of free housing and benefits , whether they worked on a LIFT Production or not . Subsequently , LIFT was the first production company to return to New Orleans after the storm , shooting Pride , starring Terrence Howard , in the Spring of 2006 . LIFT was successfully promoting Louisiana 's new nickname Hollywood South . It produced more than 30 films and TV shows , adding $250 million in much-needed revenues to a disaster-ravaged state . The industry as a whole had brought $400 million in film investments to Louisiana . MovieMaker Magazine ranked the State 4th in filmmaking in 2005 . Mayor Nagin also introduced significant initiatives moving New Orleans to the next level of the Trinity Industry with film , music , and video game production , and created a National Film Advisory Board to assist in making New Orleans a top of the line place to film movies Prospects and hopes remained high . Petal saw film production as a great way to keep skilled labor in Louisiana . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters and electricians and hairdressers . And every business in town gets used . The dry cleaners and the hotels and the car rental services . So the money gets out of the community fast . It 's non-polluting , unlike a lot of other businesses that we could attract down here . At that time LIFT was employing up to 500 people at wages starting at $20/hour. # The Film Factory # The Friday before Hurricane Katrina hit , LIFT purchased 18 acre of land in downtown New Orleans , west of the French Quarter ( intersection of St. Louis &amp; Galvez Streets ) to build a $200,000,000 , state-of-the-art production complex . The 320000sqft m2 Film Factory was to be built to withstand extreme weather events and to international standards for essential facilities . The plans included : Seven Class A sound stages ( two devoted to film school productions ) , movie and television production support spaces , production offices , central wardrobe and props , a full service film and media education center . It was also designed to house two digital media incubator labs , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the development of animation productions . It was to be the first facility in the United States to house a state-of-the-art training institute on an active motion picture studio lot . Within five years the school would have been training 750 residents a year for careers in the Louisiana production market . Film Factory was not just a building , but a massive attempt to build the first Hollywood studio outside of Hollywood , in the history of motion pictures . It included major strategic partnerships , like one with Lions ' Gate which had agreed to move many of its core operations to Louisiana and house them at the Film Factory , as well as top vendors and suppliers , such as Panavision and Kodak . According to third-party studies 1,200 motion picture production jobs were projected in Louisiana in 2009-10 . The Film Factory was to create 5,000 jobs in its first year , and 20,000 jobs by the time it reached its peak of operations . Located in the Treme area abutting downtown New Orleansthe poorest census tract in the countrythe Film Factory was an ambitious effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Similarly a Tulane study estimated that when the production studio and film institute came online in 2008 it would create nearly 2,253 direct and 1,517 indirect jobs and adding $131 million in payroll . On October 19 , 2006 Film Factory officially broke ground , with a golden shovel ceremony officiated by Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco , New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin , and his political opponent Lieutenant Governor , Mitch Landrieu . Completion was scheduled for the last quarter of 2008 . The vertically-integrated business boasted a $180,000,000 development deal with Element Films ( the movie division of billionaire club impresario Sam Nazarian 's SBE Entertainment empire ) and a $50,000,000 revolving line of credit with Merrill-Lynch to distribute films through Lions Gate and MGM . If successful , the Film Factory would have transformed LIFT into a major studio , and catapulted New Orleans ' economic standing well past its regional competitors , putting it on an economic footing with New York , Los Angeles , and Chicago . Within 5 years the developments 12-month vocational school was to train 750 local residents per year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters to hairdressers ; from electricians to graphic artists ; from visual artists to caterers , there is a career in the Film industry for every ambition and natural talent , announced CEO Petal at the Film Factory ground-breaking . And what 's more these are union jobs , with pension and health benefits , and starting salaries from $20 to $45 per hour . These are careers that will allow the people of Treme to build dignified lives on single salaries , own homes , pay for college . The City 's Executive Director of Arts and Entertainment , Ernest Collins , and Rep. Steve Scalise R-Jefferson expressed the importance of this infrastructure development to the sustainability of the film industry in Louisiana . Petal stated at the time We 've brought a lot of the industry here with cash . The trick is to not have that be the sole reason people come here . We have to try to leverage the tax incentives to build a more well-rounded industry .. This will show people that they can build a career here . People have to feel that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid # On June 1 , 2007 FBI and IRS agents raided LIFT 's offices . Unnamed Federal sources and news reports indicated that the U.S. Attorney 's office believed LIFT had been involved in massive fraud . Some estimates topped $100,000,000 . The underwriters of the Film Factory soon withdrew . LIFT tried to maintain its business , but the Louisiana Department of Economic Development banned all LIFT-related productions in the midst of all the publicity , drying up all of its development and distribution deals . The multi-agency U.S. Department of Justice investigation lasted over five years and cast a wide net , serving grand jury subpoeanas on major Hollywood studios , law firms , brokerages , and CPAs . FBI and IRS agents from New York , Ohio , Texas and California expended thousands of manhours , including multiple interviews of Kevin Kostner ( the star of the LIFT release , Mr. Brooks ) . Despite its wide scope , the investigation failed to turn up any evidence of fraud or abuse of tax credits , as United States Attorney James B. Letten had proclaimed at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pled guilty to paying a bribe to Mark Smith , the Louisiana Film Commissioner , in a matter unrelated to LIFT . He admitted receiving a $135,000 fee from LIFT CEO Malcolm Petal to help convince the State of Louisiana to allow popular music festivals like JazzFest , Essence , and Voodoo to utilize the film tax credits for their productions . Petal feared that without government assistance , New Orleans would lose these festivals in the wake of Hurricane Katrina . Bradley admitted he paid $65,000 of that fee to Smith , but that Petal had no direct knowledge of the payment . Petal pled guilty to conspiracy to bribe in the matter . and is received the maximum 5-year sentence . During his sentencing proceedings the United States ' Attorney 's office admitted they had not proved any actual harm caused by the bribe , any gain to Petal , or that Petal had any knowledge that Bradley hade made payments to Smith . Nevertheless , Eastern District of Louisiana Judge Lance Africk , a personal friend of United States Attorney Letten , sentenced Petal to the maximum 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know of the bribe itself to be guilty of conspiracy to bribe , because in a conspiracy the right hand does not need to know what the left hand is doing . He opined that the maximum sentence was warranted due to the seriousness of the offense and that Petal had lost his moral compass . # Conclusion # On January 5 , 2014 , after seven years of litigation by the State of Louisiana , claiming LIFT and Petal had committed fraud , a final judgment was issued stating tersely that the State of Louisiana would like LIFT 's actions to be considered a fraud perpetrated by an unscrupulous businessman Petal . The evidence presented does not support this conclusion . LIFT v. LED , American Arbitration Association Case No.691400023208 ( 2014 ) . LIFT 's meteoric rise and fall left many unanswered questions .

While popular amongst white conservatives as a crime fighter , he is widely regarded as a publicity hound amongst liberals , and a racist in the black community . His aggressive , yet fruitless , pursuit of LIFT which included several press conferences and the highly publicized raid , killed an unprecedented industrial revitalization project that would have brought tens of thousands of jobs to an area of entrenched poverty ( and almost exclusively African-American ) . Letten 's pro-White political leanings , and the fact that his investigation uncovered none of the promised fraud , bribery , or abuse at LIFT , led many to suspect his underlying motive was not to uncover corruption , but to arrest the development of the Film Factory , which might have shifted New Orleans balance-of-power inexorably to its Black population . This occurred at a time when some New Orleans whites felt for the first time they had an opportunity to stop the progress of black power ( due to the destruction of black-owned property in Hurricane Katrina ) . The Film Factory represented an opportunity for African-Americans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to service-industry ) salaries . Suspicion of Letten is greatly enhanced by the Company he keeps . His best friends include United States Senator David Vitter and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales . Letten notably gave Vitter a pass on a Mann Act violation for utilizing hookers in New Orleans and D.C. # TODAY # As a result of LIFT 's successful efforts to compete with international incentives , Louisiana is now the second largest production state behind California , and 39 other States have passed film incentives in the last decade . However , LIFT 's vision of utilizing the credits as a lever for broad economic development has not been adopted by any other actors , and the programs remain large give-aways to film studios , justified mainly for the public relations value of attracting film and television to one 's community . # Filmography # ; Films * ' ' Bug ' ' * ' ' The Last Time ' ' * ' ' Mr. Brooks ' ' * ' ' Premonition ' ' * ' ' Pride ' ' * ' ' Factory Girl ' ' * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ...
