@@17547514 is a stable of sumo wrestlers , part of the Isegahama ichimon or group of stables . It has a long history . As of April 2013 it had ten wrestlers. # History # Asahiyama stable is one of the oldest continually-running stables in sumo , its current incarnation dating back to 1896 . It is the only stable still in existence that can trace its lineage back directly to the days of the once-rival Osaka sumo organization where it had a strong base , producing the 28th yokozuna nishiki Daigor in 1918 . During the 1970s the stable was home to six Tongan wrestlers ( including Sione Vailahi and Tonga Fifita ) recruited by former maegashira Futaseyama , but when he died in 1975 they were caught up in a succession dispute between former maegashira Ry and the man who eventually became the new head , former komusubi Wakafutase . They sided with Futaseyama 's widow , who preferred Ry to take over , and were ultimately dismissed by the Japan Sumo Association . **21;0;Ref Watafutase led the stable until his death in 1997 .
