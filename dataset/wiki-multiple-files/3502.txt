@@32237514 Though it is no longer practiced today , Tonga 's ancient religion was practiced for over 2000 years . Missionaries arrived and persuaded King George Tupou I to convert to Christianity ; he ordered and strictly enforced that all Tongans become Christian and no longer practice the ancient polytheistic religion with its supreme god Tangaloa. # Pulotu # Pulotu was the unseen world , the domain of the god or goddess Hikule'o believed to be reached by sea . Stories told of journeys to Pulotu . Tongans identify Pulotu with the underworld , ' ' Lolofonua ' ' . Pulotu is also identified with the cemetery or graveyard . Long ago , it was believed that Pulotu could be visited by a man to recover a dead wife . Hikule'o would assemble the spirits so the wife could be found , reanimated and released . Two entrances are pointed out by Tongans . One is ' ' Ahole ' ' a deep hole on the island of Koloa , Vava'u . Ahole was the opening from which ' ' Maui Kisikisi ' ' brought fire from the underworld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island of Tofua . There are three divisions of Pulotu called ' ' Pulotu Tete ' ' , ' ' Pulotu ' Aka'aka ' ' , and ' ' Pulotu Tu'uma'u ' ' . # Gods and deities # # Tangaloa # Tangaloa , the sky god , was regarded in Vava'u as the deity who hauled up the islands of the Vava'u group , his fish hook catching in what is now the island of ' ' Hunga ' ' . The Vava'u people attributed this great act to Tangaloa instead of Maui due to the importance of Tangaloa worship in Vava'u . ' ' Tangaloa Tufunga ' ' , though said not to be a god in Niuatoputapu , is the patron of carpenters elsewhere in Tonga . # Maui # The ' ' Maui ' ' were special men or demigods ; they appeared human . Maui drew up the islands of Ata , north of Tongatapu , as well as Tongatapu with all its associated islands , then Lofanga and the other Ha'apai islands , and lastly the Vava'u.
