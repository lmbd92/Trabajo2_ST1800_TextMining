He is most closely associated with the glitch , IDM , Hardcore techno , and breakcore scenes . Kid606 's music is similar to the work of his friend and colleague Lesser , as well as hardcore and IDM acts such as Atari Teenage Riot , Autechre , Mr. Oizo , and Matmos . He is primarily inspired not by his electronic contemporaries , but by his love of the Industrial music , Death metal , and Industrial metal of the 1980s and 90s , particularly bands like Godflesh and Napalm Death . His music is known for its high tempo breakbeats and liberal use of noise and sampling , as well as its punk aesthetic , uninhibited genre-mixing , and irreverent sense of humor . However , he is equally adept at creating more serious tracks that often reside in the realm of ambient and glitch ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' and the entirety of ' ' P.S.
