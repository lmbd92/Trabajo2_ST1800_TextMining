@@13178514 Sum of absolute transformed differences ( SATD ) is a widely used video quality metric used for block-matching in motion estimation for video compression . It works by taking a frequency transform , usually a Hadamard transform , of the differences between the pixels in the original block and the corresponding pixels in the block being used for comparison . The transform itself is often of a small block rather than the entire macroblock . For example , in x264 , a series of 4&amp;times ; 4 blocks are transformed rather than doing the more processor-intensive 16&amp;times ; 16 transform . # Comparison to other metrics # SATD is slower than the sum of absolute differences ( SAD ) , both due to its increased complexity and the fact that SAD-specific MMX and SSE2 instructions exist , while there are no such instructions for SATD . However , SATD can still be optimized considerably with SIMD instructions on most modern CPUs . The benefit of SATD is that it more accurately predicts quality from both the standpoint of objective and subjective metrics . As such , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive and estimate distortion explicitly , such as in the Theora ( since 1.1 alpha2 ) encoder , as an optional metric used in wide motion searches , such as in the Microsoft VC-1 encoder , or as a metric used in sub-pixel refinement , such as in x264.
