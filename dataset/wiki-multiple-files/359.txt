@@1113514 MyoD is a protein with a key role in regulating muscle differentiation . MyoD belongs to a family of proteins known as myogenic regulatory factors ( MRFs ) . These bHLH ( basic helix loop helix ) transcription factors act sequentially in myogenic differentiation . MRF family members include MyoD , Myf5 , myogenin , and MRF4 ( Myf6 ) . MyoD is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment . MyoD is expressed in activated satellite cells , but not in quiescent satellite cells . Although MyoD marks myoblast commitment , muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the MyoD gene . This is likely to be due to functional redundancy from Myf5 . Nevertheless , the combination of MyoD and Myf5 is vital to the success of myogenesis. # Functions of MyoD # The function of MyoD in development is to commit mesoderm cells to a skeletal lineage , and then to regulate that process . MyoD may also play a role in regulating muscle repair . MyoD mRNA levels are also reported to be elevated in aging skeletal muscle . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cell cycle ( halt proliferation ) by enhancing the transcription of p21 . MyoD is inhibited by cyclin dependent kinases ( CDKs ) . CDKs are in turn inhibited by p21 . Thus MyoD enhances its own activity in the cell . # Interactions # MyoD has been shown to interact with HDAC1 , ID1 , ID2 , Retinoblastoma protein , STAT3 , CSRP3 , Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 , CREB-binding protein , TCF3 , MOS , EP300 , C-jun , Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C , Retinoid X receptor alpha and MDFI. # Coactivators of MyoD # IFRD1 is a positive cofactor of MyoD , as it cooperates with MyoD at inducing the transcriptional activity of MEF2C ( by displacing HDAC4 from MEF2C ) ; moreover IFRD1 also represses the transcriptional activity of NF-B , which is known to inhibit MyoD mRNA accumulation .
