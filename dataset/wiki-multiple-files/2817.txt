@@24778514 The mountain stream salamander or mountain stream siredon ( ' ' Ambystoma altamirani ' ' ) is a species of mole salamander that only lives in central Mxico. # Description # The mountain stream salamander grows to be about 115 mm long . Its tail is slender , has a low fin along the top , and an even smaller fin on the bottom of the tail . The tail is about 50mm . The limbs are also slender . The dorsal surface and the sides are a purplish-black color , while the belly is a purplish- lavender . The chin and lower surfaces of the limbs are clouded with a light lavender hue . The edges of the lips , tips of the digits , and the fin on the bottom of the tail are a cream color . # Habitat # The mountain stream salamander lives to the west and south of the Valley of Mexico . It lives in an altitude range of 2,700 to 3,200 m above sea level . This species lives and breeds in small streams that flow through high-elevation pine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streams of cleared pastures . Adult mountain stream salamanders live both on land and in streams . # Ecology # The mountain stream salamander goes through a metamorphic change to become an adult . The salamander starts out as larvae and can only survive in streams . As they mature they gain limbs and the ability to live on land , as well as lose their gills and fins . Some adults , and larvae , stay in the streams year-long , but other adults go off and live on land . The adults will come back to the stream to breed and lay eggs . After laying the eggs , the adult leave their babies , showing no signs of parental care . # Status # The species is currently considered an endangered species because of the huge decreases in population over the past three generations . This decrease has been caused by changes in its habitat . Illegal logging in national parks , very heavy recreational tourism , stream pollution and sedimentation , stream diversion , and the introduced predatory fishes , like trout , have all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts have all led to the death of the mountain stream species , which then leads to a decrease in the population . Because of this , the species is now protected by the Mexican law under Special Protection ( Pr ) .
