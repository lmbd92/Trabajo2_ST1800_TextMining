@@25893514 TARGIT ( TARGeted Intra-operative radioTherapy ) is a technique of giving radiotherapy to the tissues surrounding a cancer after its surgical removal . The technique was designed in 1998 at the University College London . In patients having lumpectomy for breast cancer , the TARGIT-A(lone) randomized controlled trial ( recruitment from 2000-2012 ) tested whether TARGIT within a risk-adapted approach is non-inferior to conventional course of external beam postoperative radiotherapy given over several weeks . The ongoing TARGIT-B(oost) randomized controlled trial is testing whether TARGIT tumour bed boost given after lumpectomy for breast cancer in younger patients or those with a high risk of recurrence , is superior to conventional external beam radiotherapy boost for breast cancer . # Definition of TARGIT # TARGIT is a method where the radiation is applied during an operation and targeted to the peri-tumoural tisues . TARGIT technique was designed at University College London by ( who coined the TARGIT acronym ) and Michael Baum along with Jeffrey S Tobias in 1998 . The term was first used when the technique was described , and the protocol for a randomised trial was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a special method of intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) . # Rationale of TARGIT # When breast cancer is surgically excised , it can come back ( local recurrence ) in the remaining breast or on the chest wall in a small proportion of women . Adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary if breast cancer is treated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue , as it reduces the chance of local recurrence significantly . When cancer does come back , it most commonly occurs in the tissues surrounding the original cancer ( the tumour bed ) , even though there are multicentric cancers in remote areas of the breast . This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour bed . The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed . Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) following surgical removal of the tumor have been time tested and proven to be effective . EBRT is usually given as a course of whole breast radiotherapy and an additional tumour bed boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the tumour bed where the boost dose should be applied can be missed ( geographical miss ) due to the difficulties in localization of the complex wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used . Additionally , the usual delay ( temporal miss ) between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells . These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells . Furthermore , TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells , suggesting for the first time , a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) on tumour microenvironment. # The TARGIT technique # The machine used for TARGIT is Intrabeam ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . It is a miniature and mobile X-ray source which emits low energy X-ray radiation ( max. 50 kV ) in isotropic distribution . Due to the higher ionization density caused by soft X-ray radiation in the tissue , the relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) of low-energy X-rays on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamma rays which are delivered by linear accelerators . The radiation which is produced by mobile radiation systems has a limited range . For this reason , conventional walls are regarded sufficient to stop the radiation scatter produced in the operating room and no extra measures for radiation protection are necessary . This makes IORT for breast cancer by the TARGIT technique available in most operating rooms . The surgical technique is relatively simple but needs to be meticulously followed . # Clinical applications # # TARGIT for breast cancer # The largest experience with IORT using the TARGIT technique and the best evidence for its potentials exists in breast cancer where a substantial number of patients have already been treated . # # TARGIT-A ( Alone ) # # The was an international multicenter prospective randomised phase 3 clinical trial designed to test whether a single dose of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy could replace the usual 3-6 week course of postoperative radiotherapy . The original trial original accrual goal of 2232 breast cancer patients was completed in 2010 and the results were announced at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simultaneously published online on 5 June 2010 in . The local tumour control using single-dose targeted intraoperative radiotherapy was found to be equivalent to several weeks ' of whole breast external beam radiotherapy . The difference in local recurrece rate between the two treatments at 4 years was 0.25% ( 95% CI -1.0% to +1.5% ) which means that TARGIT could be at most 1.5% worse or 1% better than whole breast radiotherapy . TARGIT also caused less radiotherapy related toxicity than whole breast radiotherapy . A brief explanation of the results is at and in a short interview . In an invited lecture at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford in 2010 , quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald , Professor John Boyages , author of ' ' l ' ' expressed concern about the early release of the TARGIT trial . He noted that the average follow-up for all patients in the trial was only 2 years and that this was far too short to determine its routine efficacy . However , this criticism had already been addressed by the authors within the original paper . At the St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus amongst over 52 breast cancer expert panelists was that TARGIT alone could be used as the only radiation treatment in selected cases after breast conserving surgery , or as a tumour bed boost instead of external beam radiotherapy boost . At the Miami Breast Cancer conference ( 1417 March 2012 ) , 91% of the audience in the surgical oncology stream felt the same . At the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium ( 38 December 2012 ) , updated results of the , which closed after recruiting 3451 patients , were presented and showed that giving TARGIT at the time of lumpectomy , gives results similar to whole breast radiotherapy in terms of breast cancer control ( particularly in ER PR positive cases ) , with fewer non-breast cancer deaths and a trend for lower overall mortality compared with conventional external beam whole breast radiotherapy . . The breast 's normal tissue tolerance to radiation does not allow a second full-dose course of EBRT , even after several years . TARGIT and other forms of partial breast irradiation may be an option for selected patients with local recurrence of breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main results in the Lancet from this updated analysis of mature data of on 11 November 2013 showed * that with longer follow up , the results are stable , * local recurrence in the conserved breast with TARGIT concurrent with lumpectomy is similar to whole breast radiotherapy , * breast cancer mortality is similar with TARGIT and EBRT , and * deaths from causes other than breast cancer- cardiovascular and other cancers - are significantly reduced . The authors concluded that TARGIT during lumpectomy should be offered as an alternative to whole breast radiotherapy in suitable patients . The results of TARGIT are discussed in . As the effect of radiotherapy on local recurrence of breast cancer is mostly in the first 2-3 years and almost none after the first 5 years , it is thought that sufficiently large number of patients in the TARGIT-A trial have an adequately long follow up # #TARGIT-B ( Boost ) # # ' ' TARGIT as a tumour bed boost : In conventional EBRT , the boost is delivered at the end of a complete course of EBRT . Clinical evidence suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TARGIT the boost can be delivered intraoperatively without any delay and more precisely as compared to conventional EBRT . A multicenter clinical trial has demonstrated that the boost administered with IORT resulted in a lower than expected rate of local recurrence ( 1.73% ) as compared to an EORTC study which used external boost radiation . As a tumour bed boost , TARGIT has been found to have a better than expected effectiveness These results have prompted the inclusion of TARGIT boost as an option to EBRT boost in national clinical guidelines of many countries including Germany . Whether TARGIT is superior to an EBRT boost is being tested in a randomised trial . # TARGIT for other organs # IORT was found to be useful and feasible in the multidisciplinary management of many solid tumours but further studies are needed to determine the benefit more precisely . Single-institution experiences have suggested a role of IORT e.g. in brain tumours and cerebral metastases , spinal metastasis , locally advanced and recurrent rectal cancer , skin cancer , retroperitoneal sarcoma , pancreatic cancer and selected gynaecologic and genitourinary malignancies .

Pilot studies : In a study which examined acute side effects after boost radiation in patients with breast cancer , treatment was well tolerated with no grade 3/4 acute toxicity . Rare adverse effects following TARGIT included wound healing problems ( 2% ) , erythema grade I-II ( 3% ) , palpable seroma ( 6% ) and mastitis ( 2-4% ) . Large prospective randomised study In the randomised TARGIT-A trial , the overall complications was equivalent between TARGIT and whole breast radiotherapy . There were more seroma needing aspiration in the TARGIT group . This was more than compensated for by the more troublesome radiotherapy related side effects that were less common with TARGIT than with whole breast radiotherapy. # Professional Society for Intraoperative Radiation Therapy # In 1998 , the International Society of IORT ( ISIORT ) was formed to foster the scientific and clinical development of IORT .
