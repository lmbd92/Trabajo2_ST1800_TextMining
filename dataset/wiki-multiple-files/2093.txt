@@16465514 Splines are ridges or teethcite web on a drive shaft that mesh with grooves in a mating piece and transfer torque to it , maintaining the angular correspondence between them . For instance , a gear mounted on a shaft might use a male spline on the shaft that matches the female spline on the gear . The splines on the pictured drive shaft match with the female splines in the center of the clutch plate , while the smooth tip of the axle is supported in the pilot bearing in the flywheel . An alternative to splines is a keyway and key , though splines provide a longer fatigue life . # Types # There are several types of splines : ; Parallel key spline : where the sides of the equally spaced grooves are parallel in both directions , radial and axial . ; Involute spline : where the sides of the equally spaced grooves are involute , as with an involute gear , but not as tall . The curves increase strength by decreasing stress concentrations . ; Crowned splines : where the sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male teeth are modified to allow for misalignment . ; Serrations : where the sides of the equally spaced grooves form a V . These are used on small-diameter shafts . ; Helical splines : where the equally spaced grooves form a helix about the shaft . The sides may be parallel or involute . This can either minimize stress concentrations for a stationary joint under high load , or allow for rotary and linear motion between the parts . ; Ball splines : where the ' teeth ' of the outer part are implemented with a ball bearing to allow for free linear motion even under high torque . # Uses # Drive shafts on vehicles and power take-offs use splines to transmit torque and rotation and allow for changes in length . Splines are used in several places on bicycles . The crank arm to BB shaft interfaces that are splined include ISIS Drive , Truvativ GXP and Howitzer , Shimano 's Octalink and many others , most of which are proprietary . Some cranksets feature modular spiders , where torque is transmitted through splines . Cassettes engage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others to enforce a fixed orientation . Disc brake mounting interfaces that are splined include Centerlock , by Shimano . Aircraft engines may have a spline upon which mounts the propeller . There may be a master spline which is wider than the others , so that the propeller may go on at only one orientation , to maintain dynamic balance . This arrangement is commonly found in larger engines , whereas smaller engines typically use a pattern of threaded fasteners instead . # Manufacturing # There are two types of splines , internal and external . External splines may be broached , shaped ( for example on a gear shaping machine ) , milled , hobbed , rolled , ground or extruded . There are fewer methods available for manufacturing internal splines due to accessibility restrictions . Methods include those listed above with the exception of hobbing ( no access ) . Often , with internal splines , the splined portion of the part may not have a through-hole , which precludes use of a pull / push broach or extrusion-type method . Also , if the part is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinding tool into the area where the splines are machined . To prevent stress concentrations the ends of the splines are chamfered ( as opposed to an abrupt vertical end ) . Such stress concentrations are a primary cause of failure in poorly designed splines.
