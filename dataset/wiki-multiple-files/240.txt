@@630514 Recorded = May , NovemberDecember 1969 , St. Louis and San Francisco , United States ' ' Bootleg Series Volume 1 : The Quine Tapes ' ' is a triple live album by the Velvet Underground . It was released on October 16 , 2001 , by Polydor , the record label overseeing the Velvet Underground 's Universal Music Group back catalogue . ' ' The Quine Tapes ' ' is currently the first and only release in the proposed Bootleg Series . It was originally recorded live by Robert Quine , a fan of the band who would later become an influential guitarist and played with musicians such as Richard Hell , Lou Reed and Lloyd Cole . The second volume in The Bootleg Series was to be an April 1967 show recorded at The Gymnasium in New York City . # The Quine Tapes # During 1969 , the Velvet Underground toured the United States and Canada , playing well over 70 dates . By this time , the band had picked up a sizeable fan base and every now and then a fan would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record a set . Most of the time , this would mean relatively simple hand-held recorders resulting in lo-fi mono audience recordings , as with this set and the 1972 live album ' ' Live at Max 's Kansas City ' ' ( ' ' 1969 : The Velvet Underground Live ' ' was the notable exception , using stereo soundboard recordings ) . Robert Quine , an avid Velvet Underground fan , used to travel to as many concerts as possible . He became friends with the band and they allowed him to record sets from the audience , occasionally asking for playbacks . Quine recorded many concerts , but as his original musicassette tapes began to wear out , he compiled four reels of what he considered the best material . These best-of reels were ultimately released in 2001 as the present ' ' The Quine Tapes ' ' set . The original musicassettes from which the reels were compiled no longer exist . Musically , ' ' The Quine Tapes ' ' finds the band in the same phase in their history as documented on ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rock and Roll , recorded at the same concert by both Quine and the Matrix sound personnel . Quine 's tapes , although lo-fi audience recordings , capture much more of the music 's ambience , especially in the larger venues , such as Washington University in St. Louis . Additionally , ' ' The Quine Tapes ' ' contains songs that the band only rarely performed by this time , such as Sunday Morning , Venus in Furs and The Black Angel 's Death Song , along with other obscurities such as Over You , Ride into the Sun , and Follow the Leader , which had never even been bootlegged in its original form . # Track listing # All tracks written by Lou Reed except as noted ; Disc one Tracks 1-11 recorded various dates in November 1969 at the Family Dog Ballroom , San Francisco , California # I 'm Waiting for the Man ( November 8 , 1969 ) 7:46 # It 's Just Too Much ( November 8 , 1969 ) 4:08 # What Goes On ( November 8 , 1969 ) 8:25 # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 6:20 # Some Kinda Love ( November 8 , 1969 ) 4:48 # Foggy Notion ( November 8 , 1969 ) ( Reed , Sterling Morrison , Doug Yule , Maureen Tucker , Hy Weiss ) 4:41 # Femme Fatale ( November 7 , 1969 ) 3:14 # After Hours ( November 8 , 1969 ) 3:05 # I 'm Sticking with You ( November 8 , 1969 ) 2:48 # Sunday Morning ( November 9 , 1969 ) ( Reed , John Cale ) 2:56 # Sister Ray ( November 7 , 1969 ) ( Reed , Cale , Morrison , Tucker ) 24:03 ; Disc two Tracks 1-5 recorded various dates in late 1969 at the Matrix , San Francisco , California # Follow the Leader ( November 27 , 1969 ) 17:05 # White Light/White Heat ( December 1 , 1969 ) 10:03 # Venus in Furs ( December 1 , 1969 ) 5:14 # Heroin ( November 23 , 1969 ) 8:11 # Sister Ray ( December 3 , 1969 ) ( Reed , Cale , Morrison , Tucker ) 38:00 ; Disc three Tracks 1-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , California **6;7327;br Track 7 recorded the 11th of May 1969 at Washington University , St.Louis , Missouri # Rock and Roll ( November 25 , 1969 ) 6:49 # New Age ( November 24 , 1969 ) 11:21 # Over You ( November 25 , 1969 ) 2:41 # The Black Angel 's Death Song ( November 23 , 1969 ) ( Reed , Cale ) 5:54 # I 'm Waiting for the Man ( November 27 , 1969 ) 11:37 # Ride into the Sun ( November 24 , 1969 ) 11:11 # Sister Ray / Foggy Notion ( May 11 , 1969 ) ( Reed , Cale , Morrison , Tucker/Reed , Morrison , Yule , Tucker , Weiss ) 28:43 # Personnel # ; The Velvet Underground *Sterling Morrison lead and rhythm guitar , backing vocals *Lou Reed vocals , rhythm and lead guitar *Maureen Tucker percussion , lead vocals on After Hours and I 'm Sticking with You *Doug Yule bass guitar , organ , backing vocals , lead vocal on Ride into the Sun ; Technical staff *Robert Quine recording engineer *The Velvet @ @
