Saarbrcken is the capital of the federal German state of Saarland , which the club is named after . The club was formed in 1996 in a merger of the two local sides Saarbrcken Wlfe and Dillingen Steelhawks . As its greatest success , the team has won promotion to the German Football League twice , in 2000 and 2010 . In this league , it qualified for the play-offs once , in 2005 . On junior level the club earned its greatest success in 2013 when it won the German Junior Bowl for the first time . # History # # Predessesor clubs # The earliest club the current ' ' Hurricanes ' ' link their past to are the Saarlouis Hurrikans , a team from Saarlouis , which was formed in 1982 . This team played in the ' ' 2nd Bundesliga ' ' from 1983 onwards , but relocated to Dillingen in 1984 and became the Dillingen Hurrikanes . In between , in 1983 , another American football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached above local league level and folded in 1989 , with its players joining the Dillingen Hurrikanes . Meanwhile , the Dillingen Hurrikanes continued playing in the ' ' 2nd Bundesliga ' ' until 1986 , when its division folded and the club had to step a level down . In 1989 , after the ' ' Wlfe ' ' had folded , the club was renamed Dillingen Steelhawks . Also in 1989 , the Saarbrcken Ghostbusters were formed as another American football club in the Saarland . The Dillingen Steelhawks continued competitive league football in the tier-three ' ' Verbandsliga ' ' , at times alongside the ' ' Ghostbusters ' ' . The team remained at local level until 1993 , when it won promotion to the central division of the ' ' 2nd Bundesliga ' ' . At this level , it lasted for only one season , but bounced back in 1995 and returned to the second level for 1996 . The Saarbrcken Ghostbusters were renamed Saarbrcken Wlfe in 1991 but were unable to rise above the third tier of the league system . By the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to the conclusion that , as individual clubs , no further improvement was possible and agreed on a merger . # Saarland Hurricanes # The team , now as the Saarland Hurricanes and still playing in the ' ' 2nd Bundesliga ' ' , had some instant success , winning its division in 1997 and 2000 . In 1997 , the Stuttgart Scorpions proved too strong , winning both promotion/relegation matches and barring the ' ' Hurricanes ' ' from the elite league . In its second attempt , in 2000 , the side overcame the Landsberg Express in the first game of the promotion round 40-22 . Landsberg did not field in the second game and the ' ' Hurricanes ' ' were qualified for the German Football League for the 2001 season . The Saarland Hurricanes were not a strong side in their following time in the GFL , only winning a game each in three of their first four seasons . However , they still managed to finish fifth and away from the relegation rank . The 2005 season was to be the club 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post season for the first time . It then lost to the Braunschweig Lions 17-32 in the quarter finals and was eliminated . After this one-off success , the club quickly declined again and finished last in its division in 2007 . Having to enter the relegation round , the team lost both games to the Munich Cowboys and found itself back in the ' ' 2nd Bundesliga ' ' . In this league , soon to be renamed German Football League 2 , the Saarland Hurricanes took two seasons to rebuilt before another division title in 2010 meant direct promotion back to the GFL , courtesy to a league expansion . The club was only able to win two of their regular season games in 2011 and finished second-last in the GFL South , avoiding relegation because of an even worse performance by the Plattling Black Hawks . In 2012 the club came seventh in the southern division of the GFL and thereby failed to qualify for the play-off . It improved to fifth place in 2013 but again did not qualify for the play-offs . # Honours # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ** Play-off qualification : 2005 ** League membership : ( 10 ) 2001&amp;ndash ; 2007 , 2011&amp;ndash ; present * GFL 2 ** Southern Division champions : 1997 , 2000 , 2010 # Recent seasons # Recent seasons of the club : * RR = Relegation round * PR = Promotion round * QF = Quarter finals * SF = Semi finals * GB = German Bowl * In the 2011 season , the game against Plattling Black Hawks was not played .
