@@20890514 ' ' Farmer v. Brennan ' ' , 511 U.S. 825 ( 1994 ) , was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a prison official 's deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate violates the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment . An amicus brief was submitted by Stop Prisoner Rape , which lauded the decision . # Case # Dee Farmer , a trans woman ( male-to-female transgender person ) , was incarcerated with the general male population after being transferred to the US Penitentiary Terre Haute , Indiana . She was repeatedly raped and beaten by the other inmates and acquired HIV as a result . Farmer claimed that the prison administration should have known that she was particularly vulnerable to sexual violence . The majority opinion of the Court agreed that it was the responsibility of prison officials to prevent prisoners from harming each other , to the point where prison officials who were deliberately indifferent were ruled liable under the Eighth Amendment . The court did not make prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... hold that a prison official may be held liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying humane conditions of confinement only if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it . # Justice Blackmun 's concurring opinion went further , saying that the government was responsible for the conditions inside even if no specific agent of the government had acted in a particularly culpable manner . # Where a legislature refuses to fund a prison adequately , the resulting barbaric conditions should not be immune from constitutional scrutiny simply because no prison official acted culpably . ... The responsibility for subminimal conditions in any prison inevitably is diffuse , and often borne at least in part , by the legislature . Yet , regardless of what state actor or institution caused the harm and with what intent , the experience of the inmate is the same . A punishment is simply no less cruel or unusual because its harm is unintended . In view of this obvious fact , there is no reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to prohibit cruel and unusual punishments only when they were inflicted intentionally . # The decision marked the first time the Supreme Court had directly addressed prisoner rape .
