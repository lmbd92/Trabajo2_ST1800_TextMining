McQuail is Emeritus Professor at the University of Amsterdam and Visiting Professor in the Department of Politics at the University of Southampton . In the early 1980s he and Dr. Sven Windahl published a book ' ' Communication Models ' ' . The book details basic communication models ( Lasswell model , Shannon and Weaver 's model , Gerbner 's model ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media systems in general . In textbook style , the book outlines each topic : it is a compilation of existing communication theories with the author 's own thoughts . He and co-author Sven Windahl spent a great deal of time on it but at the time it was nothing more than a book of theories .

Vital to the political aspect is the question of freedom and control . The newspaper press establishes its claim to freedom entirely on its political purpose of conveying opinions and spreading political and financial information . The television and radio uses political purposes of the newspaper and provides information based on a general public interest . As the television industry increases , market controls replaces political power . New media networks as Denis McQuail believes is still awaiting classifications of their amount of political freedom on the basis of privacy or content being distributed to individual users opposed to mass distribution . Denis McQuail also believes new media needs regulations to avoid misuse of monopoly power . The degree of control in the views of Denis McQuails suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood of utilizing it . Denis McQuail also believes as new media broadens freedom of communication , the controls of continual organizations alongside the market , in regards to flow , and reception should not be underestimated . The use and reception of media McQuail makes special mention in ' ' Mass Communication Theory ' ' of the difficulty that surrounds identifying specific uses of media , as well as the difficulty of understanding the reception that any specific medium may have . McQuail uses the medium of the television as an example and notes that despite the many changes and extensions that the occurred , the television is still primarily seen as a medium of family entertainment . The topic of interactivity is also breached in the book , with McQuail suggesting that the degree of interactivity is yet another defining feature that confuses the useful purpose and reception of mass media forms . # Major publications # * Mcquail , Denis ( 2010 ) , ' ' McQuails 's Mass Communication Theory ' ' ( sixth edition * McQuail , Denis ( ed. ) ( 2002 ) , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sage , London . * McQuail , Denis and Karen Siune for the Euromedia Research Group ( eds. ) ( 1998 ) , ' ' Media policy : convergence , concentration and commerce ' ' .
