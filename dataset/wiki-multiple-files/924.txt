@@4666514 ' ' Jephtha ' ' ( HWV 70 ) is an oratorio ( 1751 ) by Handel with a libretto by the Rev. Thomas Morell , based on the story of Jephtha in Judges ( Chapter 11 ) and ' ' Jephthas sive votum ' ' - Jeptha or the Vow ( 1554 ) by George Buchanan . Whilst writing Jephtha , Handel was increasingly troubled by his gradual loss of sight , and this proved to be his last oratorio . In the autograph score , at the end of the chorus How dark , O Lord , are thy decrees he wrote Reached here on 13 February 1751 , unable to go on owing to weakening of the sight of my left eye . The story revolves around Jephtha 's rash promise to the Almighty that if he is victorious , he will sacrifice the first creature he meets on his return . He is met by his beloved daughter Iphis .

Scholars disagree regarding whether he actually sacrificed her or if , as the oratorio relates , she was then dedicated to the Lord and required to observe a life of perpetual virginity . Regardless , however , the Bible makes no mention of an angel stopping what occurred . Staged performance of material based on biblical subjects was forbidden in Great Britain at the time the work was premiered . Handel 's final masterpiece was presented at the Covent Garden on 26 February 1752 , with the composer conducting , and with a cast that included two divas of the opera stage , Giulia Frasi , Handel 's ' ' prima donna ' ' since 1749 , and Caterina Galli . It was presented without scenery or costumes , divided into three acts .

The two passages occur separately within the oratorio , but during the 19th century these were often performed together in concert , as if the recitative directly preceded the aria . # Dramatis Personae # * Jephtha ( tenor ) * Iphis , his Daughter ( soprano ) * Storg , his Wife ( mezzo-soprano ) * Zebul , his Brother ( bass ) * Hamor , in love with Iphis ( alto ) * Angel ( soprano ) * Chorus of Israelites * Chorus of Priests * Chorus of Virgins # Notes #
