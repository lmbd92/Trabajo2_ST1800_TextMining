@@19483514 Huddersfield Town 's 1953-54 campaign is Town 's best ever finish in a season since World War II . Following the previous season 's promotion onslaught , Town and especially Jimmy Glazzard made sure that the previous season 's achievements were n't forgotten in a hurry . They finished in 3rd place in Division 1 with 51 points , just 6 points behind the champions Wolverhampton Wanderers . The goalscoring feats of Jimmy Glazzard , who scored 29 goals and the assistance of Vic Metcalfe , who himself scored 11 goals helped Town finish in their highest post-war finish to date . # Squad at the start of the season # # Review # Andy Beattie 's team were on an all-time high following their immediate return to Division 1 after just one season in Division 2 . The start of the season continued where the previous season left off and after 4 games , Town were top of the table with 3 wins , including a 5-1 win over Portsmouth , where Jimmy Glazzard got the first of his 3 hat-tricks that he would achieve during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 matches against Sheffield United and Aston Villa . The team 's performances kept them up in the upper realms of the division , with the chance of winning the title , not being too unrealistic . The season ground to a halt near the end , when Vic Metcalfe was forced to miss the last 7 games of the season and many say this was the reason that Town failed to win the title for the first time in 28 years . They did however finish 3rd , just 6 points behind Wolverhampton Wanderers , who Town actually beat in their penultimate game of the season . # Squad at the end of the season # # Results # # Division One # border= 2 cellpadding= 4 style= border-collapse:collapse ; text-align:center ; font-size:smaller ; !
