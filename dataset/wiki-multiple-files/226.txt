@@584514 The Book of the Law of the Lord is a book accepted as scripture by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ( Strangite ) . It is alleged to be a translation by the Strangite prophet James Strang of the Plates of Laban , originally acquired by Nephi , a leading character in the early portion of the Book of Mormon . Strang claimed to have translated them using the Urim and Thummim , which was used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon . However , the Book of the Law of the Lord bears little resemblance to the material described in the Book of Mormon as being engraved on the Plates of Laban . Rather , Strang 's book comprises a rather elaborate constitution for a Mormon kingdom , in which the Prophet-leader of the Latter Day Saint church equally rules as king over God 's kingdom on earth . It also contains various other revelations and teachings unique to Strang . # James J. Strang # James J. Strang was a lawyer and newspaper editor from New York who converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1844 . Shortly after his baptism , Joseph Smith , Jr. , founder of the church , was murdered by a mob . Upon Smith 's death , a number of individuals came forward claiming a divine mandate to lead his church , including Strang . As a recent convert , Strang did not possess the name recognition among rank-and-file Mormons held by Brigham Young and Sidney Rigdon ( two other contenders for LDS leadership ) . Hence , he faced an uphill battle in his quest to be recognized as the heir to Smith 's prophetic mantle . To advance his cause , Strang asserted that unlike Rigdon and Young , ' ' he ' ' had hard evidence of his prophetic calling . In September 1845 , he announced the discovery of the Voree Record , the final testament of an ancient Native American engraved on three brass plates dug up near Voree , Wisconsin , his headquarters at the time . However , Strang 's claims to possession of divinely-revealed ancient records , and the ability to correctly translate them , did not end there . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book of the Law of the Lord ' ' , a far more substantial work . # Alleged provenance of the book # Strang explained that the Book of the Law ( as it is often callednot to be confused with Aleister Crowley 's book of the same title ) was kept in the ark of the covenant , and was held too sacred to go into the hands of strangers . However , when the Septuagint translation was made , the Book of the Law was kept back , and ... lost to the Jewish nation in the time that they were subject to foreign powers . Thus , the various books in the Pentateuch , containing abstracts of some of the laws , have been read instead of it , until even the existence of the book has come to be a matter of doubt . Strangites believe that their Book of the Law is identical to the one mentioned in the Bible . They also identify the Book of the Law with the Stick of Judah mentioned in . This is in marked contrast to other Latter Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Bible . The LDS and Community of Christ churches , the two largest factions of the Latter Day Saint movement , each reject James Strang 's claims to prophetic leadership and his ' ' Book of the Law of the Lord . ' ' # Witnesses # Seven witnesses testified to having seen and handled the plates that Strang claimed to possess . They described them as being eighteen in number , each measuring approximately seven and three-eighths inches wide , by nine inches long . Their brazen surfaces were occasionally embellished with beautiful pictures , and all appeared to be of beautiful antique workmanship , bearing a striking resemblance to the ancient oriental languages . The witnesses ' names were : Samuel Graham , Samuel P. Bacon , Warren Post , Phineas Wright , Albert N. Hosmer , Ebenezer Page and Jehiel Savage . Wright and Post served as Apostles under Strang . Warren Post wrote in his journal that the plates weighed approximately six pounds . Although some of these witnesses later left Strang 's church , none of them is known to have ever denied their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subsequent history of Strang 's Plates of Laban , and their current whereabouts , is a mystery . # Editions of 1851 and 1856 # The Book of the Law of the Lord was published in two separate editions during James Strang 's lifetime . The first edition of 1851 contained only eighty pages and consisted of material translated directly from the Plates of Laban , with five exceptions : three revelations given to Strang , and two sections written by inspiration of God . In contrast , the edition of 1856 comprised 320 pages , including all of the text in the 1851 edition , plus ten new chapters and a series of notes added by Strang to explain the text . The 1856 edition is the one generally used by Strangites today . It was never bound with a title page or preface ; subsequent reprints have used the title page , testimony and preface from the 1851 edition . In fact , the 1856 edition was not bound at all until after Strang 's death , as he was assassinated before this was completed . Its uncut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strang 's disciples . Both editions of the Book of the Law are dated according to the year of James Strang 's reign : the 1851 edition is annotated A. R. I , while the 1856 edition carries the date A. R. VI . # Monarchy and priesthood # The most distinctive element of the Book of the Law is its overtly monarchial tone . Also of interest are the singular subdivisions Strang makes within the Melchizedek Priesthood , which his book refers to as The Priesthood of an endless life , and the Aaronic Priesthood , referred to as the Priesthood of life . In the Melchizedek Priesthood , Strang enumerates two orders , that of Apostles , and that of Priests . * Apostles are subdivided into four degrees : **The Prophet/President of the Strangite church is openly referred to throughout the book as a King , rather than as a President ( as under Joseph Smith ) . **His Counselors are designated as Viceroys . Viceroys are referred to as kings , too , though this does not indicate a share in the unique royal dignity accorded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Kingdom forever . The leader of Strang 's Apostles is designated as Prince and Grand Master of the Seventies . **A quorum of Evangelists ( not to be confused with the LDS and Community of Christ office of Patriarch ) is established , to be Apostles to a single nation , kindred , tongue or people unlike the Twelve , who were sent to ' ' all ' ' nations . Seven Evangelists formed a quorum , and Strang noted that such a body had never been organized in this dispensation . This priesthood office was unique to the Strangite organization , and does not correspond in any way to the office of Evangelist found in some other Latter Day Saint churches . * Priests are subdivided into two degrees : **High Priests were to include all inferiour Kings , Patriarchs , or heads of tribes , and Nobles , or heads of clans . Furthermore , Strang continued , They who hold it are called Sons of God . From this group , said the Book of the Law , the king was to select counsellors , judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices of Seventy and Elder as generally constituted in Joseph Smith 's church . In the Aaronic Priesthood , Strang enumerates three orders : *Priests were to teach , preach and baptize , but not ( as in the Doctrine and Covenants ) to bless the Sacrament ; that was reserved to the High Priests of the Melchizedek Priesthood . They were subdivided into two courses , one of which ( the Singers ) was opened to women : ** Sacrificators , who were to kill sacrifices in accordance with appropriate provisions of the Book of the Law see below under Animal sacrifice , and ** Singers , who were to sing during the various services to be held in Strangite temples ( no such temple was ever constructed by the Strangites , nor were its services ever apparently composed ) . *Teachers were not merely to instruct in spiritual matters , but secular ones as well ; they were to staff schools throughout Strang 's kingdom . This office , like the office of Priest ( Singer ) was opened to women , and was subdivided into five degrees : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Deacons were to serve as Stewards and keepers of the Kings prisons , and Stewards of the Kings Courts . They were subdivided into three degrees : **Marshals , **Stewards , and **Ministers . In addition , a King 's Council and a King 's Court were established . While no direct link is made between the King 's Court and the High Council established in the Doctrine and Covenants , certain parallels exist , such as requiring all members to hold the High Priesthood , and limiting their number to twelve . Although Strang briefly enjoyed the services of Apostle William Smith as Chief Patriarch of his church , he makes no mention of this office anywhere in his book . # The Decalogue # Another unique feature of the Book of the Law is its version of the Decalogue , the Ten Commandments allegedly given to Moses on Sinai . Strang 's rendering is different from any other Jewish , Catholic , Islamic or Protestant version , for it offers a commandment none of the others has : ' ' Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no other version of the Decalogue contains more than nine commandments . He equally speculates that his fourth commandment was lost perhaps as early as Josephus ' time ( circa 37-100 A.D./C.E. ) . # Ordination of women # As noted above , the Book of the Law opened two priesthood offices to women : Priest and Teacher . While only the course of Singer in the office of Priest was open to females , all five degrees in the office of Teacher were available . Furthermore , they could serve as leaders of the Singers . Strang ordained women to these ministries as early as 1851 , and permitted them to lecture in his School of the Prophets by 1856 . In contrast , the Community of Christ church opened its ministry to females in 1984 , while the LDS Church does not ordain women to priesthood offices . # Animal sacrifice # Animal sacrifice was instituted in the Book of the Law , both for forgiveness of sins and as a part of Strangite celebration rituals . However , given the prohibition on sacrifices for sin contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather , he focused on sacrifice as an element of religious celebration , especially the commemoration of his own coronation as king ( July 8 , 1850 ) . The head of every house , from the king to his lowest subject , was to offer a heifer , or a lamb , or a dove . Every man a clean beast , or a clean fowl , according to his household . The killing of sacrifices was a prerogative of Strangite Priests , but female Priests were specifically barred from participating in this aspect of the Priestly office . Firstfruits offerings were also demanded of all Strangite agricultural harvests . Animal sacrifices are no longer practiced by the Strangites , though belief in their correctness is still required . # Monotheism and the vocation of Jesus Christ # Some of the teachings in the Book of the Law differed substantially from those held by other Mormon sects . For instance , in his Note on the Sacrifice of Christ and The True God , Strang rejected both the traditional Christian doctrine of the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods . He insisted that there was but one eternal God , the Father , and that progression to godhood ( a doctrine allegedly taught by Joseph Smith ) was impossible . God had always been God , said Strang , and He was one Person ( not three , as in the traditional Christian Trinity ) . Jesus Christ , said Strang , was the natural-born son of Mary and Joseph , who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind , but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents ( rather than being begotten by the Father or the Holy Spirit ) to be able to truly fulfill his Messianic role . Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence adopted as God 's son at birth , and fully revealed as such during the Transfiguration . After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life , he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men , prior to his resurrection and ascension . Furthermore , Strang denied that God could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things were as impossible for Him as for us . Thus , he saw no essential conflict between science and religion , and while he never openly championed evolution , he did state that God was limited in His power by both the matter He was working with and by the eons of time required to organize and shape it . He spoke glowingly of a future generation who would make religion a science , to be studied by as exact rules as mathematicks . The mouth of the Seer will be opened , Strang prophesied , and the whole earth enlightened . Musing at length on the nature of sin and evil , Strang wrote that of all things that God could give to man , He could never give him ' ' experience ' ' . Thus , if free agency were to be real , said Strang , humanity must be given the opportunity to fail and to learn from its own mistakes . The ultimate goal for each human being was to willingly conform oneself to the revealed character of God in every respect , preferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or desire for reward , but rather on account of the innate loveliness of undefiled goodness ; of pure unalloyed holiness . # Other distinctive teachings # The Book of the Law taught the seventh-day Sabbath , and commanded it in lieu of Sunday . It also accredits baptism for the dead , but on a far more limited scale than that currently practiced by the LDS church . Baptisms for the dead are not performed by the Strangites today , although belief in the doctrine is still affirmed . Eternal marriage is taught in the Book of the Law , though it is not required to be performed in a temple ( as in the LDS church ) . Strangite Priests , Elders , High Priests or Apostles ( of all four degrees ) may all perform this ceremony . Eternal marriages are still contracted in the Strangite church today . Oaths are taken very seriously in the Book of the Law , and severe spiritual penalties are forewarned upon all who break their solemn word , once given . The Book of the Law permits not only the blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not to be done in anger , nor indiscriminately ; rather , it is only to be invoked on such as , on deliberate and candid thought , are found condemned to them by the Law of God ; and then the curse should be invoked as in the presence of God , the searcher of hearts ; conscious that whosoever curses in the bitterness of his ... corrupt heart , and not in the light of Gods truth , the curse will return upon him . Maledictions are also to be performed by Strangite leaders upon hereticks , schismaticks , and those guilty of gross and abominable immoralities , and acts of great cruelty and wickedness . The Strangite practice of Maledictions seems comparable to the anathemas pronounced in the New Testament and by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches . Conservation of forests and resources is mandated in the Book of the Law . Groves of trees were to be maintained upon each farm , and in each village and town . Farms and cities without trees were required to plant them , and to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to rest and to play . Strangites are prohibited by the Book of the Law from dressing ostentatiously . Various ( today mostly obsolete ) styles are banned , though allowance is made for those who are sojourning among Gentiles to imitate , to some moderate extent , their foolish and ridiculous styles , to avoid impertinent observations . The Book of the Law sanctions marriage only between persons who are not impotent , deformed , of reduced stature ( a dwarf ) , or mentally handicapped . The image of animal husbandry is invoked : The same means which will improve a breed of cattle , Strang wrote , will improve a race of men . # Polygamy # Plural marriage is sanctioned , though not expressly commanded , in the Book of the Law . The applicable text reads : Thou shalt not take unto thee a multitude of wives disproportioned to thy inheritance , and thy substance : nor shalt thou take wives to vex those thou hast ; neither shalt thou put away one to take another . Any wife already married to the prospective polygamist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to object , but not to veto the marriage . This passage seems to offer any aggrieved wife an appeal to the Judges , but how this was to be carried out is not made clear . Strang 's defense of polygamy was rather novel . He claimed that , far from enslaving or demeaning women , it liberated and elevated them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to themeven if that mate were already married to someone else . Rather than being forced to wed corrupt and degraded sires due to the scarcity of more suitable men , a woman could wed the one she saw as the most compatible to herself , the best candidate to father her children and the man who could give her the best possible life , no matter how many other wives he might have . The practice of plural marriage has never been officially proscribed in the Strangite church , unlike in the LDS church . Only twenty-two men entered into polygamy , and most of them only took one additional wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member in his church . Polygamy was apparently practiced by a few Strangites up to 1880 or so , to include Wingfield W. Watson , a Strangite High Priest who knew and served under James Strang personally . However , with federal and state bans on the practice , and a divine injunction to obey the law of the land , plural marriage has been given up in the contemporary Strangite church , though belief in its correctness is still required and affirmed . Strangites reject Section 132 of the LDS Doctrine and Covenants , regarding it as a forgery from 1852 that was never received or approved by Joseph Smith .
