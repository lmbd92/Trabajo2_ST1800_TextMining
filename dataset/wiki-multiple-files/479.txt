@@1761514 A magic sword is any mythological or fictional sword imbued with magical power to increase its strength or grant it other supernatural qualities . The archetype originated in myth and legend , and occurs regularly in fantasy fiction . Renowned swords appear in the folklore of every nation that used swords . Sometimes the sword is ascribed no powers of its own . It is famous because it is the hero 's sword , or because of its origin , as when a god gives it to the hero . Other swords keep their wielders safe or destroy their enemies . A more localized motif is the sword that has been broken and must be reforged , commonly found in Northern Europe . Such a sword symbolizes the initial defeat and loss of honor of its wielder . Subsequent victory and the restoration of honor is achieved by reforging it , either at the wielder 's hand or that of his heir . # History # It is probably that the roots of the sentient weapon myths stem from ancient peoples belief that sword making and metallurgy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forge ( ' ' fire was also given spiritual connotations ' ' ) a lump of earth was transformed into a shiny usable object that could be hammered into many shapes . Extending further from the transformation of ore into metal , the difficulty of actually obtaining a quality blade ; which took intense concentration and skill added to its esoteric qualities . While any blacksmith could manufacture a knife or an axehead only a swordsmith could create a high quality sword . The secrets of doing so were jealously guarded as well as formulas for alloys . The skill necessary to forge a balanced blade - one which is not too brittle or too soft and able to hold a usefully sharp edge - in the age before automated machines , blast furnaces , and the knowledge of molecular chemistry made the creation of a sword seem almost miraculous . A few degrees too hot or too cold within a very limited temperature range , which could only be discerned by the glowing hue of a hot billet , could make or break a sword . A lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flux and quench the blade could ruin weeks of work . Thus the swordsmith almost felt like he was one with his work , giving the process his complete devotion of concentration and thought . This led to the belief that he was actually imbuing the blade with an essence of his spirit . In Japan , the swordsmiths were so concerned with this belief that they would undergo purification rituals and meditation before even attempting to start a new blade , for fear that they may inadvertently create an evil sword . It is also important to note that in antiquity ; metal was used as money and thus a sword was a very expensive and highly prized item , a sign of wealth , status and given holy connotations in many cultures . One would only have to see how they are referenced within the Holy Books of Christians , Jews and Muslims to make this point evident . The Vikings prized their swords above all other things , handing them down from generation to generation and giving them names . The value of the blade was not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was used in . Polynesian people such as the Mori people Later as the concept of demons , spiritual possession , and elementals entered the realm of mythological themes it was only a natural leap to attribute magical properties of the swords of folklore to indwelling spirits . Magic swords may exhibit various degrees of sentience , from being merely influenced by the wielder to being able to think for itself or even control its owner . # Biblical # The Bible relates in the Book of Genesis how God , seeking to deter Adam and Eve from returning to the Garden of Eden , placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way . By some accounts , the Cherubim are replaced with the Archangel Michael , who wields a similar weapon . King David was given the sword of the slain giant Goliath by the priest Ahimelech , to which was attached extra-biblical mythology and traditions . In the Book of Revelation , Jesus is symbolically described wielding a double-edged sword that proceeds out from his mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word of truth . # Mythological # # Arthurian # In the legend of King Arthur , the king himself is related to two magical swords , in most variants . The first is the Sword In the Stone . Only Arthur could draw it out , thereby proving that he is the rightful king . In some tales , this is his only sword . In most variants , this sword was then broken , and he receives from The Lady of the Lake a new sword called Excalibur , arguably the most famous of magic swords . However , in other variants Excalibur itself is the sword in the stone . It is not clear from the various accounts of the Arthur legend whether Excalibur itself was possessed of magical powers or merely had a magical origin , though its scabbard protected its bearer from physical harm . Many interpretations of the legend appear to endow Excalibur with a cutting strength and durability beyond that of ordinary weapons . # Chinese # Ancient Chinese mythology relates the tale of L Dongbin , who slew dragons with a magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # In Norse mythology , the god Frey possessed a magic sword that struck out at Jotuns of its own accord . Many other swords appear in Norse legend in the hands of heroes . Tyrfing appears in the ' ' Hervarar Saga ' ' . Svafrlami was the King of Gardariki , and a grandson of the god Odin . He caught the dwarves , Dvalin and Durin , and forced them to forge a sword with a golden hilt that would never miss a stroke , would never rust and would cut through stone and iron as easily as through clothes . The dwarves made the sword , and it shone and gleamed like fire . However , in revenge they cursed it so that it would kill a man every time it was used and that it would be the cause of three great evils . They also cursed it so that it would kill Svafrlami himself . It would cost the life of not only Svafrlami , but also the life of the Swedish hero Hjalmar . A similar sword to Tyrfing is Dinsleif , a sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dwarf Din . Like Tyrfing , Dainsleif gave wounds that never healed and could not be unsheathed without killing a man . There is also Mistilteinn , a sword from the ' ' Hrmundar saga Gripssonar ' ' , which could never go blunt and which Hrmund won from the undead witch-king rainn . Like Tyrfing , it was taken from a barrow-wight . The various iterations of the story of the Vlsungs include several magic swords . The first magical sword which enters the story is Gram , stuck by Odin into the tree Barnstokkr in the hall of the Vlsungs . Only Sigmund could pull it out . This caused considerable envy and conflict . Eventually , Sigmund fought Odin disguised as an old man , and Odin shattered the sword . Sigmund left it for his son Sigurd , who reforged it to kill Fafnir . In the Nibelungenlied , Siegfried ( the Middle German equivalent to Norse Sigurd ) discarded Gram in exchange for another magic sword , Balmung . Wagner 's version of the story calls the sword Nothung , rather than Balmung . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which appears both in the Anglo-Saxon poem Waldere and in the German/Scandinavian ' ' irekssaga ' ' . Beowulf wielded the sword Hrunting that was according to the poem annealed in venom . The sword was useless against Grendel 's Mother . In desperation Beowulf grabbed a giant sword of great age and with it took off the head of the she monster . # Japanese # In Japanese mythology , there is a magical sword called Kusanagi , which was one of the three crown jewels given to the Emperor Jimmu by the goddess Amaterasu . Additionally , the katana forged by Masamune and Muramasa were reputedly of such high quality as to be near-magical . In the case of the Masamune and Muramasa blades , it was believed that some element of the smith 's personality was imputed into the blade . These three swords have been used extensively in popular culture since then , especially in the realm of video game RPGs. # Spanish # More pragmatical , Spanish legends talk too about magical swords .

The sword was given to him by Astra , who had been holding it since the days when Zeus had used it to battle the Titans . Because it was Tempred ' ' sic ' ' with Adamant , it was described as being able to cleave through anything . In ' ' Der Ring des Nibelungen ' ' , Richard Wagner drew on the legends of Grimm for the sword Nothung , belonging to the hero Siegmund and later reforged by his son Siegfried and used by him to kill Fafner . It is finally used by Siegfried to shatter the spear of his Grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hero of Lewis Carroll 's poem Jabberwocky slays the Jabberwock with a vorpal sword . Although the poem does not define the word vorpal ( and contains many nonsensical words with no meaning ) , the term has been adopted in role playing games to describe a sword which possesses a magical ability to decapitate those against whom it is wielded . In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien such as ' ' The Lord of the Rings ' ' , many magical swords , usually with powers for good , are wielded by important characters . Gandalf uses his sword Glamdring in his battle with the Balrog , who wields its own sword of flame . Glamdring 's sister blade , Orcrist , is buried with Thorin Oakenshield under the Lonely Mountain in ' ' The Hobbit ' ' . Bilbo , Frodo and Samwise carry the sword Sting .

In Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman 's Darksword series the Darksword is a sword capable of absorbing magic . Michael Moorcock created a sinister magic sword in ' ' Stormbringer ' ' , wielded by Elric of Melnibon . This black sword has the power to suck out the souls of its victims and transfer their energy to its holder .

In Robert Jordan 's The Wheel of Time is the sword ' ' Callandor ' ' , which is actually not a sword , but a powerful Sa'angreal shaped as a sword and made out of crystal . It is kept within the Stone of Tear . It can only be taken by the Dragon and is a major sign of his return .

Terry Goodkind 's series is named for its magical weapon , the Sword of Truth . This blade , with the word Truth inlaid into the handle , factors into many of the moral decisions made by Richard Rahl , the series ' protagonist . The blade , like most magic in the series , is focused on need . The sword 's master is referred to as the Seeker of Truth . The Seeker gains the swordmastery of all those that have wielded the blade previously . Many false Seekers have carried the sword , but a true Seeker can only be named by the First Wizard ( Rahl is named by his grandfather , Zeddicus Zorander ) . A true Seeker has the ability to turn the blade white when he kills in compassion and forgiveness . Richard has done this twice .

The sentiment of the enchantment follows that of the To thine own self be true ... advice to Laertes . A prospective wielder , upon drawing the blade for the first time , is made to confront all their personal flaws , shortcomings , fears , delusions and morally questionable acts . If the being 's psyche can not deal with the revelations , they might not be permanently harmed , but the blade is unusable to them .

Nightblood is a sentient sword which was given a direction when awakened . This direction was to ' destroy evil . ' However , being a sword , Nightblood could not judge right and wrong and killed almost indiscriminately . Simply undoing the clasp ( which was extraordinarily tempting for one without a pure heart ) was enough for nightblood to utterly destroy the one holding it . Nightblood was often recovered by Vasher sticking clean through a man , not even unsheathed . Nightblood , when fully drawn consumed Its user 's BioChromatic breaths at an alarming rate , while sending tendrils of darkness out to destroy anything the sword deemed ' evil .
