The Lacy was first recognized in 2001 by the Texas Senate . In Senate Resolution No. 436 , the 77th Legislature honored the Lacy as a true Texas breed . In June 2005 , Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the blue Lacy as the official State Dog Breed of Texas . As expected , the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas . However , as the breed becomes more well recognized , there are breeding populations being established across the United States , and in Canada . # Description # # Appearance # Lacy dogs are strong and fast , lightly built but proportional within the height-to-weight ratio .
