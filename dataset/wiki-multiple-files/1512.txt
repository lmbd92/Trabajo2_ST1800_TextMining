@@10135514 Leandro Bisiach ( 1864 &amp;ndash ; 1 December 1945 ) was an Italian violin maker , who was born in Casale Monferrato and died in 1945 at Venegono Superiore near Varese. # Biography # Trained as a violinist , he made his first violin on his own and received praise for it . Thus he decided to become a violin maker and moved to Milan to work with the Antoniazzi family in 1886 . With them he established a partnership of exceptional importance , putting to good use his artistic skills and business ability . After having moved his workshop to various premises , he retired to his villa in Venegono leaving his sons Andrea and Carlo Bisiach to continue the business in Milan . Bisiach was an outstanding figure in the commerce of antique violins but above all had the merit of raising a generation of great luthiers , among whom for example Gaetano Sgarabotto , Igino Sderci , Pietro Borghi , Ornati and Garimberti come to mind . His workshop can be considered as the most important in Italy in that period .

As is known , after the death of the last great Cremonese Masters after the middle of the 18th century , only the Cerutis remained in Cremona to prevent that memorable tradition from dying out completely . It was the Antoniazzis who undertook the task of transferring the scant knowledge saved from oblivion from Cremona to Milan . However the most important event for the renaissance of violin-making in Lombardy was certainly the meeting between Riccardo Antoniazzi and Leandro Bisiach ; the latter , thanks to his talent , his taste and his business ability succeeded in founding , at the end of the 19th century , a workshop which soon gained international fame .

Other clients included Sarasate , Joachim , and violincellist Alfredo Piatti , who trusted his violoncello ( a Stradivarius , from which Bisiach made a reproduction ) to no-one else .

In fact Storioni had been a student of Carlo Bergonzi , the only true custodian of the secrets of Stradivarius . We must say that Leandro Bisiach honoured his significant inheritance , which in actuality was not only symbolic . By one of those tricks of fortune that make one suspect the hand of destiny , Leandro senior had come into possession of tools and models that had belonged to the various old Cremonese masters . This seems strange enough in itself , a curious coincidence .
