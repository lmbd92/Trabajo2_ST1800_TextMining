@@2670514 The Cis-Sutlej states were a group of states in Punjab region , lying between the Sutlej River on the north , the Himalayas on the east , the Yamuna River and Delhi District on the south , and Sirsa District on the west . These states were ruled by the Scindhia dynasty of the Maratha Empire , various Sikh sardars and other Rajas of the Cis-Sutlej states paid tributes to the Marathas , until the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803-1805 , after which the Marathas lost this territory to the British . # History # During the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803-1805 , some of the states in the region gave their allegiance to British General Gerard Lake . At the conclusion of the war , the frontier of British India was extended to the Yamuna , and an 1809 agreement with Ranjit Singh , ruler of the Sikh Empire west of the Sutlej , brought the states under formal British protection . The Cis-Sutlej states included Kaithal , Patiala , Jind , Thanesar , Maler Kotla , and Faridkot .

A number of states were confiscated , or acquired by Britain under the Doctrine of Lapse . After the First Anglo-Sikh War the full administration of the territory became vested in this officer . In 1849 the Punjab was annexed to British India , when the Cis-Sutlej states commissionership , comprising the districts of Ambala , Ferozepore , Ludhiana , Thanesar and Simla , was incorporated with the new Punjab Province . The name continued to be applied to this division until 1862 , when , owing to Ferozepore having been transferred to Lahore Division , and a part of Thanesar to Delhi Division , it ceased to be appropriate . The remaining tract became known as the Ambala Division . The princely states of Patiala , Jind , and Nabha were appointed a separate political agency in 1901 . Excluding Bahawalpur , for which there was no political agent , and Chamba , the other states were grouped under the commissioners of Jullunder and Delhi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Districts and states # # Districts # *Ambala District *Ludhiana District *Firozpur District *Hissar District # Princely states # *Patiala *Jind *Nabha *Faridkot *Maler Kotla *Kalsia *Kaithal
