It was the first album that was both released and distributed by the label . Following the release of the EP ' ' Back to the Known ' ' ( 1985 ) , Bad Religion went on a temporary hiatus , then reunited with its original members and went to work on its first full-length studio album in five years . Although ' ' Suffer ' ' was not charted in Billboard , it has been cited by some critics as one of the most important punk rock albums of all time . After its release , ' ' Suffer ' ' quickly became Epitaph Records ' best seller and was the label 's best-selling album for a number of years , until the release of The Offspring 's 1994 highly acclaimed album ' ' Smash ' ' . A plethora of third-wave punk bands cite this album as a major inspiration ; NOFX 's Fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Background # Bad Religion was formed in Southern California in 1980 by vocalist Greg Graffin and guitarist Brett Gurewitz . The pair hired Jay Bentley on bass and Jay Ziskrout on drums and began writing songs . In 1981 , the band released their eponymous debut EP on the newly formed label , Epitaph Records , which was and continues to be managed and owned by Gurewitz . In 1982 , the band released their first full-length album , ' ' How Could Hell Be Any Worse ? ' ' , gaining the band a sizable following . During the recording of that album , Ziskrout left the band and was replaced by Pete Finestone . After experiencing more lineup changes and releasing their second album , ' ' Into the Unknown ' ' ( 1983 ) , to lukewarm response , Bad Religion called it quits in 1984 . In 1984 , Greg Hetson of Circle Jerks fame , who had played the guitar solo for Part III on ' ' How Could Hell Be Any Worse ? ' ' , teamed up with Graffin on the song Running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teenage Lovedolls ' ' . Soon after , Graffin reassembled Bad Religion with Hetson replacing Gurewitz , who had gone into rehab for his drug problem . Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower , rock and roll version of their original sound with the EP ' ' Back to the Known ' ' ( 1985 ) , but disbanded temporarily soon after . By 1987 , Gurewitz had cleaned up his drug issues and struggled to find some kind of employment . After taking some vocational courses and a raft of odd jobs , he became a studio engineer and owner of a recording studio . Gurewitz noted , I really enjoyed , still enjoy , being a recording engineer , but I had a terrible time trying to make any money . And my hours were horrible . I just knew I wanted to be in music .

During recording sessions , the band even demoed a revamped version of Fuck Armageddon ... This Is Hell , a track previously released on ' ' How Could Hell Be Any Worse ? ' ' .

Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner played guitar on Best for You and Jennifer Finch sang back-up vocals on Part II ( The Numbers Game ) . # Reception and legacy # The album received critical acclaim , Robert Christgau gave the album a B saying ; This comeback is hailed as a hardcore milestone , probably because it 's coherent . Relatively sane as their bitter analysis is--and I mean relative to both hardcore despair and mainstream complacency--it sounds a little pat .
