@@9091514 The Predil Pass or Predel Pass ( , ) ( el . 1156 m ) is a high mountain pass on the border between Italy and Slovenia . # Geography # The pass is located in the Julian Alps , between the peaks of Mount Mangart to the north and Mount Kanin to the south . It connects Cave del Predil , part of the Italian municipality of Tarvisio in the northwest , with the municipality of Bovec in the Upper Soa ( Isonzo ) Valley in Slovenia . On the Italian side , the state highway No. 54 ' ' del Friuli ' ' leads from Tarvisio and the Canal Valley along the Slizza Creek to Lake Predil , where the route to the Sella Nevea Pass in the south branches off , and uphill to the Predil crest . On the Slovenian side , the road No. 203 runs downhill to Log pod Mangartom and further to Bovec . The village of Strmec na Predelu lies just beneath the border crossing . # History # The road was built from 1319 onwards by the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prince-Bishops of Bamberg , then the possessors of the Carinthian lands in the north . However , the importance of the trade route diminished after the Aquileia territory in the south was incorporated into the ' ' Domini di Terraferma ' ' by the Republic of Venice in 1420 . Since 1754 the Predil Pass marked the border between the Duchy of Carinthia with the lands of the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca ( part of the Austrian Littoral from 1849 ) in the southeast , both part of the Habsburg Monarchy . During the War of the Fifth Coalition , an Austrian contingent under Captain Johann Hermann von Hermannsdorf on 18 May 1809 fought against the French forces moving from the Kingdom of Italy upon the Battle of Tarvis . Hermannsdorf was killed in battle , in 1851 a memorial was erected in his honour . In 1903 a 4.5km mi long tunnel ( ' ' toln ' ' ) was built beneath the pass , serving miners from Log pod Mangartom on their way to the lead mines in Cave del Predil .
