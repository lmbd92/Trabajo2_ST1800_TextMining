@@594514 In the Roman Catholic Church , a transitional deacon is a celibate man who has been ordained a deacon and who intends to become a priest . Transitional deacons are usually ordained to the diaconate after they complete their third year at the theological seminary . For several centuries , all Roman Catholic deacons were in this transitional stage between layman and priest . The role of permanent deacon , usually a married man who is unable to remarry after ordination if his wife predeceases him , was revived after the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s . In the Old Catholic churches , whose formal existence stems from the First Vatican Council in 1870 , a transitional deacon may generally be celibate , engaged in a relationship or married . In many groups within the Old Catholic church , only men could be ordained deacon . Women would not be a deacon but in fact a female deaconess , which is still laity , and not related to the office of priesthood . Liturgically , the role of deacon is the same as the Roman Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Anglican tradition ( such as the Episcopal Church in the United States of America ) , a transitional deacon is similar except that , in keeping with the differences in the requirements for priesthood from the Roman Catholic church , they may be a man or woman and may be married . Another historical difference is that an Anglican transitional deacon had to first be a graduate of an approved seminary , theological college or distance education program . Today , however , many dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America are changing that and allowing ordination of transitional deacons during the final year of seminary . The Episcopal Church also ordains individuals as vocational deacons ( see Anglican ministry ) .
