@@5292514 Patrona Halil ( c. 1690 in Bitola - November 25 , 1730 in Constantinople ) , was the instigator of a mob uprising in 1730 which replaced Sultan Ahmed III with Mahmud I and ended the Tulip period . Halil was born to an Albanian family in Hurpisht , a village near Bitola . He became a Janissary and after joining a Janissary rebellion in Ni and leading one in 1720 in Vidin , he moved to the capital . He was known to have engaged in petty trade and crafts like working as a hammam attendant . Halil was also a former sailor . He spent much of his time at meyhanes of Galata . Halil was known as Horpeteli Arnavut Halil after his place of birth and nationality but his Albanian compatriots called him ' ' Patrona ' ' ( Vice Admiral ) . His followers were 12,000 janissaries , mostly Albanians . For weeks after the revolt , the empire was in the hands of the insurgents .

A Greek butcher , named Yanaki , had formerly given credit to Patrona and had lent him money during the three days of the insurrection . Patrona showed his gratitude by compelling the Divan to make Yanaki Hospodar of Moldavia . Yanaki however never took charge of this office . The Khan of the Crimea assisted the Grand Vizier , the Mufti and the Aga of the Janissaries in putting down the rebellion . Patrona was killed in the sultan 's presence after a Divan in which he had commanded that war be declared against Russia . His Greek friend , Yanaki , and 7,000 of those who had supported him were also put to death . The jealousy which the officers of the Janissaries felt towards Patrona , and their readiness to aid in his destruction , facilitated the exertions of Mahmud I 's supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
