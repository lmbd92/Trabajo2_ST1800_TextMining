@@582514 mLAN , short for Music Local Area Network , is a transport level protocol for synchronized transmission and management of multi-channel digital audio , video , control signals and multi-port MIDI over a network . # Description # The mLAN protocol was originally developed by Yamaha Corporation , and publicly introduced in January 2000 . It was available under a royalty-free license to anyone interested in utilizing the technology . mLAN exploits several features of the IEEE 1394 ( FireWire ) standard such as isochronous transfer and intelligent connection management . There are two versions of the mLAN protocol . Version 1 requires S200 rate , while Version 2 requires S400 rate and supports synchronized streaming of digital audio at up to 24 bit word length and 192 kHz sample rate , MIDI and wordclock at a bitrate up to 400 Megabits per second . With the proper driver software , a computer-based digital audio workstation can interact with mLAN-compliant hardware via any OHCI-compliant FireWire port . mLAN consumes the entire bus bandwidth when operating and non-mLAN devices can not share the same Firewire connection , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other sound devices on the same Firewire bus when mLAN Manager software is running . The transport layers of mLAN have been standardized as IEC 61883. # End of life # By 2005 , over 100 manufacturers were part of the mLAN Alliance however very few actual products have surfaced . As of early 2008 , mLAN appeared to have reached the end of its product life . Third party developers have discontinued or retracted their mLAN products from the market , and Yamaha itself ceased any new releases of mLAN hardware or updates to the mLAN software and drivers . Even though recent FireWire based products from Yamaha can interoperate with earlier mLAN devices using a computer , any mention of mLAN is notably absent from new product announcements and driver updates over the last few years . # Supporting products # * Yamaha 01X digital mixing hub * Yamaha i88x audio/MIDI interface * Yamaha mLAN16E/mLAN16E2 options for Yamaha Motif , Yamaha Motif ES , Yamaha S90 ES , Yamaha Motif XS , Yamaha Motif-Rack XS * Yamaha MY16-mLAN option for Yamaha digital mixers * Korg EXB-mLAN option for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio/MIDI interface * Kurzweil KMLN8 8 Channel mLAN I/O option for KSP-8 Multi-Channel effects processor # See also # * ADAT * Audio over Ethernet * MADI * MIDI * Open Sound Control * RTP MIDI * ZIPI
