@@663514 nickname = Fighting Scots -- The College of Wooster is a private liberal arts college primarily known for its emphasis on mentored undergraduate research . It has roughly 2,000 students and is located in Wooster , Ohio , United States ( approximately 95 mi north-east of the state capital Columbus ) . Founded in 1866 by the Presbyterian Church as the University of Wooster , it was from its creation a co-educational institution . The school is a member of The Five Colleges of Ohio and the Great Lakes Colleges Association . As of June 30 , 2012 , Wooster 's endowment stood at approximately $232 million . Wooster is one of forty colleges named in Loren Pope 's influential book ' ' Colleges That Change Lives ' ' , in which he called it his ... original best-kept secret in higher education . It is consistently ranked among the nation 's top liberal arts colleges , according to U.S. News and World Report . In US News ' Best Colleges 2013 , for the 11th year in a row , Wooster is recognized for its outstanding undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I.S. Only two schools have been named to both lists in each of the past 11 years : Wooster and Princeton University . # History # Founded as The University of Wooster in 1866 by Presbyterians , the institution opened its doors in 1870 with a faculty of five and a student body of thirty men and four women . Wealthy Wooster citizen Ephraim Quinby donated the first 22 acre , a large oak grove situated on a hilltop overlooking the town . After being founded with the intent to make Wooster open to everyone , the university 's first Ph.D . was granted to a woman , Annie B. Irish , in 1882 . The first black student , Clarence Allen , began his studies later in the same decade . In the pre-dawn hours of December 11 , 1901 , a fire destroyed the five-story ' Old Main ' building , the centerpiece of the campus . Within two years , it was replaced by several new buildings which ( after substantial renovations within the last 30 years ) remain the primary structures for the classes , labs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iconic center of campus ) , Scovel , Severance ( which together form a large courtyard in front of Kauke Hall ) , and Taylor Hall . About ten years after the fire and rebuilding , there were eight divisions , including a medical school whose faculty outnumbered those in the college of arts and sciences . However , the university had gradually begun to define itself as a liberal arts institution and , in 1915 , after a bitter dispute between the faculty and the Trustees , chose to become The College of Wooster in order to devote itself entirely to the education of undergraduate students in the liberal arts . The enrollment of the college is kept intentionally small , around 2000 students , to allow for close interaction between faculty and students . In the 1920s , William Jennings Bryan , a prominent Presbyterian layman , attacked the college for its teaching of evolution , which had been championed by president Charles F. Wishart , and called for the General Assembly of the church to cut off funding to the college . But Wishart defeated Bryan for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college continued to teach evolution . The College # Academics # Upon completion of at least 32 courses , students may earn a Bachelor of Arts , Bachelor of Music , or Bachelor of Music Education degree . In addition to the programs listed below , students may design their own major with approval from the registrar and the Provost . Some of the pre-professional programs are cooperative ones in which students spend a certain period of time at the College of Wooster before transferring to accelerated courses at other colleges and universities . # Independent Study program # The College of Wooster is especially noteworthy for its Independent Study program , in which all students work one-on-one with a faculty advisor to complete a written thesis or other significant project during the course of the senior year , usually about 50 to 100 pages in length . The student also presents an oral defense of the thesis before a faculty committee . The program , begun in 1947 by Howard Lowry ( the College 's 7th President ) , has received considerable attention from other colleges and universities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 2003 , the independent study program at Wooster was recognized by ' ' US News and World Report ' ' as the second best ' senior capstone experience ' in the US , behind only Princeton University . Wooster ranks 14th in the United States among independent colleges whose graduates earned Ph.D . ' s between 1920 and 1995 ( according to the Baccalaureate Origins of Doctorate Recipients , 1998 ) . Preparation and completion of the thesis can be time consuming , and led to one view in which a student , writing in the weekly ' ' The Wooster Voice ' ' , suggested that the independent study program be interwoven with career planning as well as applications to graduate schools . Special traditions have been developed surrounding Independent Study . Upon completion , a student receives a yellow button saying ' I did it ! ' as well as the highly coveted Tootsie Roll . The tradition began in 1974 when the registrar at the time , Lee Culp ( also a graduate of the College of Wooster ) , gave out candy along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because it was cheap to buy in bulk . Beginning in 1989 , buttons were given out to indicate the order in which theses had been handed in . The ' due date , ' or the last day that students can turn in their completed Independent Study project , is the first Monday after spring break . On I.S. Monday , the pipe band strikes up including drums and trumpets , and with the Provost leading the way , the seniors march through the Kauke Arch in a jubilant parade , described by one professor as a celebration of both scholarship and survival , ending at Kittredge dining hall , where a celebratory dinner with advisors and college administrators follows . # Libraries # The College of Wooster Libraries consists of three branches ( Andrews Library , The Flo K. Gault Library and The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall ) and a music library located at the Scheide Music Center . Andrews Library , the largest library in the system , houses more than 850,000 volumes and can accommodate over 500 readers . Andrews Library houses the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center . The Flo K. Gault Library , built as an addition to Andrews Library in 1995 , primarily serves as a place for class seniors to work on their Independent Study projects . The Gault Library contains carrels devoted to Independent Study for every senior student of the humanities and social sciences . The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall ( 1900 , 1998 ) , which is the oldest branch in the system , served as the original academic library for the college from 1900 to 1962 . After three decades as an art museum the building reopened as the science library in 1998 , with substantial funding from the Timken Foundation of Canton , Ohio , and now primarily serves students in the math and sciences departments . The library provides Independent Study carrels for math and science seniors . * CONSORT : The College of Wooster became a founding member of the Five Colleges of Ohio Consortium in 1996 .

After varsity athletics returned in 1901 , Wooster became an early member of the Ohio Athletic Conference ( OAC ) . In 1983 , Wooster ( along with the rest of the Ohio Five ) broke away from the OAC to form the North Coast Athletic Conference ( NCAC ) . The NCAC , which competes at the non-scholarship Division III level of the NCAA , was founded primarily on the principle of offering women equal opportunity to participate in varsity sports . In its first season of competition , 198485 , the NCAC sponsored 21 sports , eleven for men and ten for women . Women 's softball was added in 1998 , and women 's golf in 2010 , giving the NCAC its current 23 sports .
