After several close calls throughout the rest of the decade , and a thoroughly hard time at the hands of the record industry , she eventually saw chart action in 1969 , before mostly forgoing live performance in 1979 to concentrate on writing and production . She experienced a fashionable , Brit-led surge in cult popularity beginning in the 1990s and returned to live performance in mid-1998 . Sands is still actively recording and performing today . # Biography # Evie Sands was born Evelyn Lourette Sands in Brooklyn , New York , cutting her first singles by her mid-teens : The Roll / My Dog ( ABC 10458/1963 ) , Danny Boy I Love You So / I Was Moved . ( Gold 215/ 1964 ) .

Prior to its release , a test pressing of Sands ' recording was stolen by a Chicago-based producer , who shopped it to established Chess Records recording artist Jackie Ross , who was coming off the major pop/soul hit Selfish One . Ross who was unaware of the duplicity involved , and who left Chess shortly afterwards and her producers loved the song , and recorded , pressed and released the record within 48 hours , beating Sands ' version to the street by a week . Backed by the marketing and promotional muscle of Chess Records , and with Ross ' name attached , this version unsurprisingly received the lion 's share of airplay . The subsequent legal struggle set back Sands ' career before it had had a chance to get started . By the time Chess withdrew the Ross single from the marketplace , Sands ' version would only break through in the few cities ( like Los Angeles ) that had thus far stayed ' on the fence ' , waiting to see which version to play . Sands ' follow-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amidst the post Take Me chaos , leaving Brit invaders The Hollies clear to score a hit cover in the spring of 1966 . That same year , Sands debuted on Cameo-Parkway Records and would continue the pattern of songs introduced by Sands becoming successful for other artists , when in 1967 , Sands ' latest single , the Chip Taylor-penned Angel of the Morning , got caught up in label 's business problems . Despite the single being one of the most-requested radio songs wherever played , and the initial 10,000 copies selling out , the label 's pending bankruptcy aborted the record 's potential success ; a few months later , the unknown Merrilee Rush would score a Top Ten single with the song . Sands ' last single release on Cameo-Parkway was Billy Sunshine in January 1968 , the tracking reaching ' ' Billboard s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart before Cameo 's demise . In 1969 Sands scored with the A&amp;M single Any Way That You Want Me , a Chip Taylor composition previously recorded by both the American Breed and the Troggs in 1966 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Any Way That You Want Me also reached the Top Ten or better in Columbus , Ohio , Houston , Texas , San Diego , California , and a number of other cities ; it reached No. 53 ' ' Billboard ' ' Hot 100 , tying Don Ho 's Tiny Bubbles for longevity among 1960s singles failing to reach that chart 's top 50 ( at 17 weeks ) , and eventual sales are estimated at 500,000 units . Sands ' debut album , also named ' ' Any Way That You Want Me ' ' , was released on A&amp;M in 1970 , several months after the single had peaked . Evie made her recorded debut as a songwriter on the album with It 's This I Am - covered years later by Beck and Beth Orton , respectively . A Sands album to be produced by Val Garay for Buddah Records was announced in March 1971 but did not come to fruition : rather the 1975 release ' ' Estate of Mind ' ' on the Capitol Records Haven label ended Sands ' five-year absence from recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album marked Sands ' continuing as a songwriter , also collaborating with Richard Germinaro and veteran songwriter Ben Weisman . Two tracks from the album , Lambert and Potter 's You Brought The Woman Out Of Me and the Sands-Weisman-Germinaro collaboration I Love Makin ' Love To You , both approached major hit status . They wound up peaking at No. 50 , with Sands would see the latter included on the ' ' ButterFly ' ' album by Barbra Streisand . Several other Sands songs from the Estate of Mind album were also covered by a number of artists , including Dionne Warwick , Dobie Gray , Dusty Springfield , Frankie Valli , Gladys Knight , Arthur Prysock , The Manhattans , Cher/Gregg Allman , Jose Feliciano and Phyllis Hyman . After a final 1976 single release on Haven : a remake of The Way You Do the Things You Do , Sands next release was on RCA who issued the album ' ' Suspended Animation ' ' - produced by Sands and Michael Stewart in the spring of 1979 ; Sands had actually begun working with co-producer Michael Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members David Hungate , Steve Lukather and Greg Phillinganes , and also Lee Ritenour and Buzz Feiten , and the vocalists backing Sands included Toto frontman Bobby Kimball , Bill Champlin of Chicago and on the track Lady of the Night - Dusty Springfield . Despite its prestigious personnel ' ' Suspended Animation ' ' did n't make a real chart impact for its single releases and Sands focused mostly on writing and production in the music business for almost twenty years . As with her previous album , a few of the songs were covered by several artists , including Helen Reddy , Linda Clfford , Phyllis Hyman , June Pointer , The Weather Girls and Shirley Bassey . Karen Carpenter recorded two songs for her solo album , but they remained unreleased . In 1982 , Sands co-produced ( with Leslie Ann Jones ) the Holly Near album Speed Of Light .

Additional musicians and singers included , Sands-electric guitar , acoustic guitar and backing vocals , Sheila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tillery-backing vocals . The album was recorded and mixed in San Francisco , California at The Automatt . In late 1996 , Sands went to see Chip Taylor perform at a club gig and he invited her onstage to perform with him . Despite not having kept actively in touch through the previous years , the experience was so successful that the two re-ignited their collaboration along with Al Gorgoni , resulting in the critically acclaimed ' ' Women In Prison ' ' LP , which was released in 1999 ( and again in 2000 ) on Taylor 's Train Wreck records . A more rootsy project than the blue-eyed soul of her late 1960s-1970s output , the album consisted of various Sands-Taylor-Gorgoni originals , including a duet with Lucinda Williams on the track Cool Blues Story . Several tracks fared well on UK/Euro indie charts . After the reconnection with Taylor , Sands returned to performing in 1998 . Sands and Taylor did some shows in the UK and Europe when the album was released , including London , Glasgow , Brussels and several dates in Holland . Sands ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Any Way ...
