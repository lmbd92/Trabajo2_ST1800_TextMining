@@17133514 Thomas Ellis ( 1625 &amp;ndash ; April 1673 ) was a Welsh clergyman and antiquarian . # Life # Ellis was born at Ystumllyn , near Criccieth , Caernarvonshire . He matriculated at Jesus College , Oxford in 1640 , graduating with a B.A. degree in 1644 , and taking his M.A. degree in 1646 . In 1648 , when the Parliamentary visitors came to the college , and Ellis was asked whether he meant to submit to the authority of Parliament , he replied that he could not without the hazard of shipwrackinge of my soule . He later submitted and was appointed Fellow of the College in 1649 , although he was a critic of the Parliamentary-appointed Principal , Michael Roberts . Ellis kept his fellowship on the Restoration , becoming vice-principal under Francis Mansell . He hoped to be appointed to succeed Mansell in 1661 , but the position went to Leoline Jenkins and Ellis then gave up his teaching duties ( although he retained his fellowship until 1667 ) . Ellis had a particular interest in the study of Welsh history . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hengwrt intended to publish a new edition of ' ' The Historie of Cambria ' ' by David Powel and asked Ellis to complete the work , using Vaughan 's notes as well as his own . However in 1663 , after 128 sheets of the book had been printed , Ellis complained that all of Vaughan 's material had been published in 1661 by Percie Enderbie and refused to continue . ' ' Memoirs of Owen Glendowr ' ' , published in 1775 , was attributed to Ellis , but Sir John Edward Lloyd later showed that Vaughan had written it , with Ellis simply being the copyist . In 1665 , King Charles II , his court and Parliament moved to Oxford to escape the plague , and Ellis 's fortunes improved . He succeeded his kinsman John Ellis as rector of St Mary 's , Dolgellau , Merionethshire . He died in April 1673 in Ystumllyn , and was buried there .
