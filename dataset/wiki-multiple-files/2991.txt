@@26580514 In mathematical analysis , a Pompeiu derivative is a real-valued function of one real variable that is the derivative of an everywhere differentiable function and that vanishes in a dense set . In particular , a Pompeiu derivative is discontinuous at any point where it is not 0 . Whether non-identically zero such functions may exist was a problem that arose in the context of early-1900s research on functional differentiability and integrability . The question was affirmatively answered by Dimitrie Pompeiu by constructing an explicit example ; these functions are therefore named after him . # Pompeiu 's construction # Pompeiu 's construction is described here . Let <math> sqrt3x </math> denote the real cubic root of the real number <math> x . </math> Let <math> qjjin N </math> be an enumeration of the rational numbers in the unit interval <math> 0 , , 1 . </math> Let <math> ajjin N </math> be positive real numbers with <math> textstylesumj aj **16;473; Define , for all <math> xin 0 , , 1 </math> : <math> g(x) : =sumj=0infty , aj sqrt3x-qj . </math> Since for any <math> xin0 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than or equal to ' ' a ' ' <sub> j </sub> in absolute value , the series uniformly converges to a continuous , strictly increasing function g(x) , due to the Weierstrass M-test . Moreover , it turns out that the function ' ' g ' ' is differentiable , with : <math> gprime(x) : =frac13sumj=0infty fracajsqrt3(x-qj)20 , </math> at any point where the sum is finite ; also , at all other points , in particular , at any of the <math> qj , </math> one has <math> textstyle gprime(x) : =+infty . </math> Since the image of <math> g </math> is a closed bounded interval with left endpoint <math> 0=g(0) , </math> up to a multiplicative constant factor one can assume that ' ' g ' ' maps the interval <math> 0 , , 1 </math> onto itself . Since ' ' g ' ' is strictly increasing , it is a homeomorphism ; and by the theorem of differentiation of the inverse function , its composition inverse <math> f , : =g-1 </math> has a finite derivative at any point , which vanishes at least in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of <math> 0 , , 1 </math> ( actually , it vanishes in many other points ; see below ) . # Properties # * It is known that the zero-set of a derivative of any everywhere differentiable function is a ' ' G ' ' <sub> </sub> subset of the real line . By definition , for any Pompeiu function this set is a ' ' dense ' ' G <sub> </sub> set , therefore by the Baire category theorem it is a residual set . In particular , it possesses uncountably many points . * A linear combination ' ' af ' ' ( ' ' x ' ' ) + ' ' bg ' ' ( ' ' x ' ' ) of Pompeiu functions is a derivative , and vanishes on the set ' ' f ' ' = 0 ' ' g ' ' = 0 , which is a dense ' ' G ' ' <sub> </sub> by the Baire category theorem . Thus , Pompeiu functions are a vector space of functions . * A limit function of a uniformly convergent sequence of Pompeiu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a derivative , due to the theorem of limit under the sign of derivative . Moreover , it vanishes in the intersection of the zero sets of the functions of the sequences : since these are dense ' ' G ' ' <sub> </sub> sets , the zero set of the limit function is also dense . * As a consequence , the class ' ' E ' ' of all bounded Pompeiu derivatives on an interval ' ' a ' ' , ' ' b ' ' is a ' ' closed ' ' linear subspace of the Banach space of all bounded functions under the uniform distance ( hence , it is a Banach space ) . *Pompeiu 's above construction of a ' ' positive ' ' function is a rather peculiar example of a Pompeiu 's function : a theorem of Weil states that ' ' generically ' ' a Pompeiu derivative assumes both positive and negative values in dense sets , in the precise meaning that such functions constitute a residual set of the Banach space ' ' E ' ' .
