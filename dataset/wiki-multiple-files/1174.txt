One of each of the two notice each other and are obviously infatuated . They walk up to the cage between them and when their hands touch they begin to dance intensely . They continue to dance energetically and spontaneously until they touched someone else , at which time the energy would transfer to them and that person would start to dance while the person who touched them stopped . # Charts # class= wikitable ! align= left Chart ( 2006 ) ! align= center Peak **6;11945;br position
