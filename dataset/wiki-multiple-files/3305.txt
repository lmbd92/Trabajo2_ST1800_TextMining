@@30259514 The Triumph Super 9 was first introduced by the Triumph Motor Company in 1931 at a price of 185 . It continued through into 1933 . It had an RAC rating of 8.9 hp . The Super 9s were the first Triumphs to use 12-volt electrics ( early Southern Crosss still used 6-volt for a short period ) and the first to be fitted with a Coventry Climax engine , which was made under licence by Triumph . Two 6-volt batteries were housed under the rear passenger floor , while the prototype had a single 12-volt battery on the bulk head . Many of the chassis and transmission components were left overs from the Super 7s and 8s. # Engine # The Coventry Climax engines are of the IOE configuration , with a bore of 60 mm and a stroke of 90 mm , giving 1018 cc . Generally a Solex side-draught carburettor was fitted . During 1931 the rear of the engine was supported on a 3/16-inch steel plate spanning across the chassis , consequently the gearbox bell housing was deep and with the starter alongside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallower bell housing , the starter was then repositioned alongside the engine . This arrangement was used on later Super 9s &amp; 10s and on Glorias . The cooling waster is circulated by thermal syphon aided by the sloping shape of the aluminium water manifold on the head . The dynamo is driven by a Duplex chain with the distributor mounted at the rear end of the dynamo . A top speed of 60 mph was obtainable with a cruising speed of 45 mph . Petrol consumption in the region of 35 mpg for a car weighing 19 cwt. unladen. # Steering # Steering is by worm and wheel , the drop shaft attached to the wheel is on three keyways so it can be turned through 120 deg. to compensate for wear . Also adjustment is provided for engagement of the worm to the wheel . # Transmission and suspension # Transmission is through a single -inch clutch plate along with a 4-speed-and-reverse gear box . The hand brake operated a transmission brake attached to the rear end of the gear box . A conventional Hardy-Spicer prop shaft connected it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wheel with under slung worm making for a low floor . The brakes are Lockheed hydraulic acting on -inch drums with one leading and one trailing shoe on all 4 wheels . The petrol tank is at the rear , unlike Super 7s which had a gravity tank . Fuel was pumped either by Autovac or SU Petrolift . Suspension consists of 4 semi elliptic springs on rubber bushes damped by Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers . Cars after 1931 replaced the rubber bushes with bronze bushes and grease nipples . Wheels were of the Magnum type with 5 studs fitted with 4.5019-inch pneumatic tyres . The car had a track of 3 ft in and a wheelbase of 7 ft 8 in. # Bodies # There were three significant models on the same chassis , a 4-door six-light saloon , a 4-door tourer and a 2-door 4-seat tourer known as the Southern Cross . The front doors on the saloon were hinged at the front , while those at the back were hinged to the rear . A sliding sun roof was standard , operated by a rotating handle above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not appear on the prototype . The most noticeable differences between 1931 cars and the later models was a change to the radiator surround and different profiling of the front wings . # Accessories # Optional extras were a luggage rack , chrome bumpers and Stevenson Jacking system . The upholstery was leather cloth with leather seating . The only known Super 9 to have Bedford Cord throughout is the prototype ; this also has a smokers vent in the roof which is shown on brochures , but is not seen on any production 9s . Instruments consisted of a speedometer , clock , oil gauge and ammeter . After 1931 a petrol gauge was added , prior to this a fuel tap was incorporated to give a reserve supply . Dash switches consisted of , a dash light , interior light , ignition , and a starter button , also choke and fast running control . External lights switching , battery charge rate , and ignition timing were all at the centre of the steering wheel . # References #
