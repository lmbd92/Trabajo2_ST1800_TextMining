@@38864514 ' ' Queloides ' ' is an ongoing cultural and curatorial project in Cuban art that seeks to highlight the persistence of racist stereotypes and ideas of racial difference in Cuban society and culture . Initiated in 1997 by artist Alexis Esquivel and by art critic Omar Pascual Castillo , who organized the exhibit ' ' Queloides I Parte ' ' , the project was later led by the late art critic Ariel Ribeaux Diago , who organized two important additional exhibits : ' ' Ni msicos ni deportistas ' ' ( Neither musicians nor athletes , 1997 ) , for which he wrote an award-winning essay , and ' ' Queloides ' ' ( 1999 ) . Queloides or keloids are raised scars that , many in Cuban believe , appear most frequently on the black skin .
