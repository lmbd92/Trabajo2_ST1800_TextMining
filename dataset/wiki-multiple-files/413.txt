On September 12 , 2006 , he lost a primary campaign for the United States Senate seat that was being vacated by Maryland U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes. # Early life # Mfume was born Frizzell Gerald Gray in Baltimore , Maryland , October 24 , 1948 , the eldest of four . His father , a truck driver , abandoned his family in Gray 's youth . Upon the death of his mother , Mfume dropped out of high school at sixteen to begin work as many as three jobs at a time to support his three sisters . He also began hanging around street corners , sometimes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was locked up a couple of times on suspicion of theft because he happened to be black and happened to be young . Speculation as to the degree of his entanglement with the law has varied , especially as he later came into prominence . He became father to five children with several different women during his difficult teenage years , whom he actively supports ( and who actively support him in his politics ) to this day . He has since adopted one child as well . At age 23 , it came upon Gray to change his life for the better . He returned to his studies and obtained his GED , going on to begin studies at the Community College of Baltimore , where he served as the head of its Black Student Union and the editor of the school newspaper . He went on to attend Morgan State University , where he graduated ' ' magna cum laude ' ' in 1976 . He would go on to attain an M.L.A. in Liberal Arts in 1984 , concentrating in International Studies at Johns Hopkins University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage and his success over his beginnings , he legally changed his name to Kweisi Mfume , a name from Ghana that translates to Conquering Son of Kings . # Politics # In 1978 , Kweisi Mfume was elected to the Baltimore City Council , serving there until 1986 . His political stance was against that of then-mayor William Donald Schaefer , who Mfume believed had ignored the many poor neighborhoods of the city . It was a contentious matter , but despite his strong opinions he learned the art of political compromise . He was perceived by many to have had some success during his stay in office , a fact perhaps reflected by his subsequent election to the United States House of Representatives in 1986 despite a torrent of criticism , directed in no small part against his early past . Serving in Maryland 's 7th Congressional district for five terms , Kweisi made himself known as a Democrat with an apparent balance between strong progressive ideologies and a capacity for practical compromise , representing a district that included both West Baltimore and suburban and rural communities , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American inner cities . In his fourth term he was made chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus . In February 1996 , Mfume left the House to accept the presidency of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , stating that he could do more to improve American civil rights there than in the Congress . He reformed the association 's finances to pay off its considerable debt while pursuing the cause of civil rights advancement for African Americans . Though many in Baltimore wanted Mfume to run for mayor in the 1999 election , Mfume stayed with the NAACP . Mfume served this position for nine years before stepping down in 2004 to pursue other interests . Mfume is a member of the Prince Hall Freemasons and Omega Psi Phi fraternity. # 2006 United States Senate race # On March 14 , 2005 , Mfume announced that he would seek the U.S. Senate seat of senator Paul Sarbanes ( D-MD ) , following the announcement by Sarbanes that he would not run for re-election in 2006 . Multiple candidates ran for the Democratic nomination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , 2006 , and Mfume lost the race to U.S. Congressman Ben Cardin. # After the Senate race # In the wake of his primary defeat , Mfume was believed to be considering running for mayor of Baltimore in 2007 , though he had not publicly expressed interest in such a run . On November 13 , 2006 , Mfume told a Baltimore-area radio station that I do n't have any plans to run for mayor . She incoming mayor Sheila Dixon 's worked for and deserves an opportunity to lead . .. I want her to succeed . I want the city to be united . I think at this point we owe her at least the opportunity to try to lead it . In late 2010 , he was again rumored to be considering a run in the Baltimore mayoral election , 2011 . In May 2013 , Mfume was named Chairman of his alumnus , Morgan State University . He assumed the position of July 1 , succeeding the universities ' interim Chair Martin Resnick.
