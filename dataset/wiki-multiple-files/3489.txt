It had been raised to county status by George of Podbrady , with the intention that it would serve as a territory for his descendants . George 's son Henry the Elder had lived on Glatz Castle as the first Count of Glatz . At his death , however , he left huge debts to his sons and they saw themselves forced to sell the county to Ulrich . On behalf of the peasants , the Knights Hans von Pannwitz , Melchior Donig , Georg von Bischofsheim and Heinrich von Kauffung agreed to the sale , as did the Estates of Glatz . The Free Judges personally paid hommage to Ulrich . Henry the Elder 's widow , Ursula of Brandenburg , who had received the county as her dower on the occasion of her marriage , also agreed .
