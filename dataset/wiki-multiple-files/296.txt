This serial marks the departure of Jackie Lane as Dodo Chaplet and also the first appearance of Michael Craze and Anneke Wills as new pending companions Ben Jackson and Polly . It is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craze , and the final complete serial from the William Hartnell era. # Plot # The TARDIS lands in London , near the Post Office Tower . The Doctor is unsettled by a sensation of a strange energy nearby . Visiting the newly completed Tower , the Doctor and Dodo meet Professor Brett , the creator of WOTAN ( W ill O perating T hought AN alogue ) , an advanced problem-solving computer that thinks for itself . Curiously , WOTAN even knows what the word ' TARDIS ' stands for . In four days ' time , on ' ' C-Day ' ' , WOTAN will be linked to other major computers to take them over , including those of the White House , Cape Kennedy and the Royal Navy . Dodo goes with Polly , Brett 's secretary , to the local Inferno nightclub , where they meet Able Seaman Ben Jackson , while the Doctor attends a Royal Scientific Club meeting about WOTAN , led by Sir Charles Summer . Before Brett can depart the GPO Tower for the meeting , he is hypnotised by a humming noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronics colleague , from the meeting and takes him to WOTAN , who is likewise possessed by the computer . Major Green , the chief of security in the Tower , is also taken over , and sends WOTAN 's control signals to Dodo at the nightclub via telephone . Going to the tower , WOTAN tells her Doctor Who is required . Bring him here . WOTAN has concluded that mankind can not develop the world any further , and intends to take over using an army of War Machines - mobile computers like itself . Using its hypnotic control , WOTAN enlists a workforce to construct 12 War Machines around London , which is the first capital to become controlled . One of these machines is built in a warehouse in Covent Garden , close to the Inferno nightclub . Dodo , the Doctor , Ben and Polly leave for Sir Charles ' residence , where the Doctor has been invited to stay , in a taxi that drops off a tramp by the nightclub . Looking for a place to sleep , the tramp discovers Brett and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is caught , and killed when he tries to escape . The next day , Dodo manages to get the Doctor to telephone Brett at the GPO Tower , and he is nearly possessed by WOTAN . Thinking the Doctor is now controlled , Dodo gives herself away by revealing that the War Machines are being constructed in strategic points in London . The Doctor breaks WOTAN 's hypnotic control over her , and she is sent to stay with Sir Charles ' wife in the country to recover . When Polly fails to show up to a luncheon with Ben , the Doctor sends the lad to investigate the area around the nightclub , after reading about the death of the tramp in the newspaper . Ben also discovers the War Machine in the warehouse , now fully assembled and being tested under Major Green 's supervision . Ben is detected by the Machine , and caught by the now hypnotised Polly . However , Ben is spared when Polly states that WOTAN requires all the slave labour we can find . While working with the others , Ben learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day . He escapes , although seen yet not stopped by Polly , and alerts the Doctor and Sir Charles . Polly is sent back to the Tower to be punished by WOTAN . Under Sir Charles ' instruction , an army taskforce investigates the warehouse , but their weapons are somehow disabled by the War Machine . They are forced to retreat , but when Doctor stands defiantly before the Machine as it emerges from the warehouse , it stops - it had not been completely programmed . With the deactivation of Machine 3 , the workmen , including Major Green , are released from its control . Examining the Machine 's programming , the Doctor learns that the 11 others have been built across London , and are meant to attack at noon today . Soon after , there are reports of another War Machine - Machine 9 - taking to the streets , having gone rogue while it was being tested . With the help of the army , the Doctor traps the Machine in an electromagnetic forcefield - paralysing it - and reprogrammes it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Machine 9 , and drags Polly out of the WOTAN room as the Machine enters and attacks the immobile computer . Krimpton is killed , but WOTAN is destroyed before it can give the order for the other 10 War Machines to commence their attack - and Brett and all the others who have been hypnotised return to normal . Ben and Polly meet the Doctor at the TARDIS , to explain that Dodo has decided to stay in London . The Doctor thanks them and heads into the police box - followed by Ben and Polly , who enter the TARDIS with the intent to return Dodo 's key , which the Doctor dropped earlier . They are then suddenly whisked off into time and space ... # Continuity # WOTAN refers to the Doctor as Doctor Who the only time the character is ever given this name within the series ' narrative ( though he was credited as such in the end titles from the start of Season 1 until the end of Season 18 of the classic series , and then again in Series 1 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of the acronym TARDIS . This serial is the only time during the black-and-white era of the series when the crew of the TARDIS is completely replaced , with the Doctor being the only continuing character . This serial marks the last appearance of the St. John Ambulance emblem on the TARDIS ' exterior door until the Eleventh Doctor 's tenure begins in 2010 's The Eleventh Hour . The story appears to end on 20 July 1966 - the date given in dialogue for the Second Doctor story ' ' The Faceless Ones ' ' , also set in London , where Ben states that that is the same date as when he and Polly joined the TARDIS . The Past Doctor Adventures novel ' ' The Time Travellers ' ' by Simon Guerrier is set in an alternative reality where the Doctor had not been around to stop WOTAN . The villain is never referred to by name , only as the Machine , and while he was overthrown thousands were left insane by his mind-control and Britain was reduced to a technologically backward dictatorship . The decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producers felt that the audience was becoming bored with the purely historical episodes that had been a major element of the show to date . As a result , this story marks the beginning of the turn away from historical stories . The next two historical stories , ' ' The Smugglers ' ' ( which immediately follows ' ' The War Machines ' ' ) and Season 4 's ' ' The Highlanders ' ' , were to be the last purely historical stories until Season 19 's ' ' Black Orchid ' ' . # Production # Working titles for this story included ' ' The Computers ' ' . The idea for this story came about when Kit Pedler was being interviewed for a position as science adviser to the series . The producers asked all of the interviewees what would happen if the recently built Post Office Tower somehow took over . Pedler suggested that it would be the work of a rogue computer that communicated with the outside world by means of the telephone system . The producers liked this suggestion and not only offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( one of the few to feature a ' Story Idea by ' credit ) . Pat Dunlop was then hired to write a full set of teleplays from Pedler 's idea , but quit after becoming busy with other work , and the teleplays were subsequently done by Ian Stuart Black , who had also written the previous serial , ' ' The Savages ' ' . Only one War Machine prop was actually constructed ; the production team changed the numbers , to represent the different machines . The titling style of each episode in this serial differs from the standard titles of other serials . Instead of a title overlay , after the Doctor Who logo has faded , the screen shifts to a solid background containing four inversely coloured rectangles aligned down the left-hand side ( reminiscent to an old-style computer punch card ) . The title , one word at a time , scrolls upwards - THE , WAR , MACH , INES - with a final flash displaying the complete title on two lines . Another flash reveals the writer , the next flash reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual episode number . All of the lettering displayed in this titling sequence is shown in a retro-computer font . Each of the four episodes ' title sequences have slight variations to them . # Casting # Sandra Bryant appeared in ' ' The Macra Terror ' ' , as did John Harvey . John Rolfe later played Sam in ' ' The Moonbase ' ' and Fell in ' ' The Green Death ' ' . Frank Jarvis later played Ankh in ' ' Underworld ' ' and Skart in ' ' The Power of Kroll ' ' . Michael Craze provided the voice of a policeman heard in Episode four . WOTAN received a credit as And WOTAN at the end of the first three episodes , the only time a fictional character was credited as itself in the series . Jackie Lane 's contract expired midway through production of this story . She does not appear again after episode two ; Dodo 's off-screen departure is relayed to the Doctor by Polly . # Missing episodes # Aside from its soundtrack ( recorded off-air by fans ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1970s . The master videotapes for the story were the last of those starring William Hartnell to be junked , surviving until 1974 . The 16mm film telerecording copies held by BBC Enterprises were also the last of their kind to be destroyed , surviving until 1978 , shortly before the junking of material was halted by the intervention of fan Ian Levine . In 1978 , a collector in Australia provided a copy of episode 2 . Later in 1984 copies of all four episodes were returned from Nigeria . Episodes 2 , 3 and 4 all had cuts to them , but most have been restored due to a combination of the other copy of episode 2 , material used in a promotional item on the BBC 's ' ' Blue Peter ' ' and censored clips from Australia . Some of the restored footage did not have its accompanying soundtrack , and so the missing sound was restored from the off-air recordings . ' ' The War Machines ' ' is the last surviving complete serial from the William Hartnell era ; the following serial ( ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Hartnell 's final serial ( ' ' The Tenth Planet ' ' ) is missing episode 4 . This serial is also the only one featuring Michael Craze and Anneke Wills as Ben and Polly that is complete . To date , only episodes 3 and 4 do not exist in their entirety as was originally intended . Episode 3 is missing a visual brief bit of dialogue with Krimpton talking . This was replaced in the VHS release with a combination of a shot of WOTAN with the accompanied dialogue from the off-air recordings . Episode 3 is also missing around 59 seconds worth of the battle in the warehouse . Episode 4 is missing only a small amount of material . The first instance occurs with the man in the telephone box . Part of the continuing close-up of the man talking on the telephone is missing , but this was compensated on the VHS release by continuing in audio-only over the top of the beginning of the high shot of the phone box . There are also two lines of dialogue missing when Polly reports back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-instated for the VHS release as it was felt that there would n't be enough visual material to drop into the gap . The DVD release has all of the episodes recreated and restored to their original length , as well as a 9-minute documentary showing how the episodes were reconstructed from all the disparate sources . # Broadcast and reception # In 2009 , Patrick Mulkern of ' ' Radio Times ' ' praised the contemporary edge taken with ' ' The War Machines ' ' , though he wrote that the plot was mechanical with several improbabilities . DVD Talk 's J. Doyle Wallis gave ' ' The War Machines ' ' three out of five stars , calling it serviceable with Wotan and its henchmen lacking depth . Den of Geek also gave the story three stars , highlighting Hartnell 's performance and opining that the story holds up well , though there were some plot holes . Arnold T Blumburg of IGN rated the story 7 out of 10 , noting that the concept had aged but it was entertaining . However , he criticised Dodo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sometimes seemed lost in the setting . ' ' The A.V. Club ' ' reviewer Christopher Bahn , on the other hand , described the plot as pretty good if not a classic , with an appealing B-movie sensibilitythis feels like a better , if equally cheaply made , version of the kind of movie featured on ' ' Mystery Science Theater 3000 ' ' . However , he criticised the abrupt departure of Dodo . Johnathan Wilkins of ' ' Dreamwatch ' ' gave the serial a score of 9 out of 10 , calling it something of a forgotten masterpiece , mostly due to Hartnell 's performance . However , he noted that the War Machines themselves were too dull and boxy . In 2013 , Ben Lawrence of ' ' The Daily Telegraph ' ' named ' ' The War Machines ' ' as one of the top ten ' ' Doctor Who ' ' stories set in the contemporary time . # Commercial releases # # In print #setbetween= A novelisation of this serial , written by Ian Stuart Black , was published by Target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was released on VHS in 1997 , with an item from ' ' Blue Peter ' ' and a BBC1 globe ident ( from the first part of the story ) as extras .
