@@13869514 A Defence of Poetry is an essay by the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley , written in 1821 and first published posthumously in 1840 in ' ' Essays , Letters from Abroad , Translations and Fragments ' ' by Edward Moxon in London . It contains Shelley 's famous claim that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world . # Background # The essay was written in response to his friend Thomas Love Peacock 's article The Four Ages of Poetry , which had been published in 1820 . Shelley wrote to the publishers Charles and James Ollier ( who were also his own publishers ) : : I am enchanted with your ' ' Literary Miscellany ' ' , although the last article has excited my polemical faculties so violently that the moment I get rid of my ophthalmia , I mean to set about an answer to it ... It is very clever , but I think , very false . To Peacock Shelley wrote : : Your anathemas against poetry itself excited me to a sacred rage . . . .

' ' A Defence of Poetry ' ' was eventually published , with some edits by John Hunt , posthumously by Shelley 's wife Mary Shelley in 1840 in ' ' Essays , Letters from Abroad , Translations and Fragments ' ' . # Editorial introductions # Shelley sought to show that poets make morality and established the legal norms in a civil society thus creating the groundwork for the other branches in a community . In ' ' Gateway to the Great Books ' ' , Volume 5 , Critical Essays , Robert M. Hutchins and Mortimer J. Adler wrote : : : In A Defence of Poetry , Shelley attempts to prove that poets are philosophers ; that they are the creators and protectors of moral and civil laws ; and that if it were not for poets , scientists could not have developed either their theories or their inventions . Poets introduce and maintain morality . The mores so created are codified into laws . The social function or utility of poets is that they create and maintain the norms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Writers ' ' , David Perkins wrote : : : ... Shelley was mainly concerned to explain the moral ( and thus the social ) function of poetry . In doing so , he produced one of the most penetrating general discussions on poetry that we have . # Major themes # Shelleys argument for poetry in his critical essay is written within the context of Romanticism . In 1858 , William Stigant , a poet , essayist , and translator , wrote in his essay Sir Philip Sidney that Shelley 's beautifully written ' ' Defence of Poetry ' ' is a work which analyses the very inner essence of poetry and the reason of its existence , its development from , and operation on , the mind of man . Shelley writes in ' ' Defence ' ' that while ethical science arranges the elements which poetry has created , and leads to a moral civil life , poetry acts in a way that awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought . In ' ' A Defence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language reveals a human impulse to reproduce the rhythmic and ordered , so that harmony and unity are delighted in wherever they are found and incorporated , instinctively , into creative activities : Every man in the infancy of art , observes an order which approximates more or less closely to that from which highest delight results .. This faculty of approximation enables the observer to experience the beautiful , by establishing a relation between the highest pleasure and its causes . Those who possess this faculty in excess are poets and their task is to communicate the pleasure of their experiences to the community . Shelley does not claim language is poetry on the grounds that language is the medium of poetry ; rather he recognises in the creation of language an adherence to the poetic precepts of order , harmony , unity , and a desire to express delight in the beautiful . Aesthetic admiration of the true and the beautiful is provided with an important social aspect which extends beyond communication and precipitates self-awareness .

Social and linguistic order are not the sole products of the rational faculty , as language is arbitrarily produced by the imagination and reveals the before unapprehended relations of things and perpetuates their apprehension of a higher beauty and truth . Shelley 's conclusive remark that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world suggests his awareness of the profound ambiguity inherent in linguistic means , which he considers at once as an instrument of intellectual freedom and a vehicle for political and social subjugation .
