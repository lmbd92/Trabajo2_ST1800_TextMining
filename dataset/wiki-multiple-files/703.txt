@@3026514 NOTOC ' ' Mirror Blue ' ' is the seventh studio album by Richard Thompson , released in 1994 . The follow-up to 1991 's successful ' ' Rumor And Sigh ' ' was recorded in January 1993 with Mitchell Froom once again in the producers chair . Despite the increase in sales for his previous two albums , ' ' Mirror Blue ' ' was held back . The delay was partly due to changes at the top at Capitol Records which saw long time Thompson fan and supporter Hale Milgrim being replaced by Gary Gersh . When the album was eventually released it did not enjoy the record company support given to Thompsons previous releases on Capitol . Unusually for a new Thompson release , ' ' Mirror Blue ' ' was not given a warm welcome by the critics . Criticism of the album was centered on the controversial production rather than on Thompsons songs and playing , both of which are strong on this album . Thompson : I thought it was a sort of deconstruction of the rock rhythm section .. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the records Mitchell had done with Suzanne Vega and Los Lobos and the couple of records engineer Tchad Blake had done with Tom Waits . All of which I thought were terrific records and they all had a kind of character to them a sound that was really trying to strip away some clichs , like why have a snare drum , why the backbeat ? And just looking at the song and seeing what does the song need , whats going to work ? The critics did not agree and the album was slammed for its unusual percussion and its lack of reverb . The charge was that the heavy-handed production drowned the songs . Mitchell Froom was cast as the villain of the piece , but Thompson seems to have been at least in favour of the production and quite probably a willing participant . Despite the critical backlash and the poor sales , some of the songs on the album have become concert staples and favourites of Thompsons fans . In particular Beeswing a tale about a travelling girl and the prices that she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the choices they make has come to be regarded as one of Thompsons very best compositions . Songs such as Mingus Eyes , Easy There , Steady Now and I Ride In Your Slipstream have a jazzy feel and impressionistic lyrics , showing that whatever else he was doing Thompson was continuing to extend his artistic range . On March 10 , 2009 , The Way That It Shows was released as a downloadable song for the video game Rock Band 2 . Despite the title of the list , ' ' Guitar World ' ' placed ' ' Mirror Blue ' ' at number 51 in their Superunknown : 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994 list . # Track listing # All songs written by Richard Thompson . # For The Sake Of Mary 4:19 # I Cant Wake Up To Save My Life 3:11 # MGB-GT 3:35 # The Way That It Shows 6:08 # Easy There , Steady Now 4:43 # King Of Bohemia 3:42 # Shane And Dixie 4:05 # Mingus Eyes 4:47 # I Ride In Your Slipstream 4:06 # Beeswing 5:30 # Fast Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4:28 # Personnel # *Richard Thompson guitar , vocals , mandolin *Mitchell Froom keyboards *Jerry Scheff bass guitar , double bass *Pete Thomas drums , percussion *Christine Collister backing vocals *Michael Parker backing vocals *John Kirkpatrick - accordion , concertinas *Danny Thompson - double bass on Easy There , Steady Now *Alistair Anderson - concertina , Northumbrian pipes *Tom McConville - fiddle *Martin Dunn - flute *Philip Pickett - shawms # References # * ' ' Richard Thompson - The Biography ' ' by Patrick Humphries .
