@@13231514 birthplace = Birmingham , England Bernard Patrick Bunny Larkin ( born 11 January 1936 ) is an English former professional footballer who played at inside forward or wing half . He played in the First Division of the Football League and in European competition for Birmingham City , and in the Football League for Norwich City , Doncaster Rovers , Watford and Lincoln City . # Biography # Larkin was born in Digbeth , Birmingham . He joined local club Birmingham City as a 16-year-old wing half , signing professional forms at 18 . He made his debut at inside left in October 1956 , when he was nearly 21 ; the club had a big squad in those days , and it was not unusual for a player to be well into his twenties before getting into the first team on a regular basis . : When I joined the club the staff was bigger than is normal nowadays . We even had pros playing for the fifth team and by the time you reached the ' A ' team there were some very good players indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another six games that season . He played more frequently the following season , filling in at right-half for Johnny Watts . He took part in both legs of the semi-final of the 195558 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against Barcelona , though he missed the replay . His career changed in November 1958 , when he was selected at inside left in place of the ageing Peter Murphy . Between then and the end of the season he scored 23 goals in all competitions , including four goals in the early rounds of the 195860 Fairs Cup , which made him the club 's top scorer for the 195859 season . He attributed his goalscoring success to being two-footed : : I 'd always scored goals wherever I 'd played . I had the advantage of being able to use both feet to shoot . That meant that you did n't have to change your position when the ball came to you . There do n't seem to be many players around nowadays that can do that . He contributed another goal in the Fairs Cup semi-final , but by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and left the club , transferred to Norwich City for a fee of 10,000 . An incident in which he overslept and missed the flight to a European away game did not help his cause . He spent two seasons at Norwich , then went on to Doncaster Rovers , Watford , Lincoln City and to non-league clubs including Wisbech Town , Nuneaton Borough , King 's Lynn and Stevenage Athletic . He had the distinction of being the first Lincoln City player ever to be substituted in the Football League . After retiring from football he settled in the Norwich area and became a salesman for a bakery firm . # Honours # *with Birmingham City **Club 's top league scorer 1959
