@@27082514 ' ' Babesia bovis ' ' is a single-celled protozoan parasite of cattle which occasionally infects humans . It is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa , which also includes the malaria parasite . The disease it and other members of the genus ' ' Babesia ' ' cause is a hemolytic anemia known as babesiosis and colloquially called Texas cattle fever , redwater or piroplasmosis . It is transmitted by bites from infected larval ticks of the order Ixodida . It was eradicated from the United States by 1943 , but is still present in Mexico and much of the world 's tropics . The chief vector of ' ' Babesia ' ' species is the southern cattle fever tick ' ' Rhipicephalus microplus ' ' ( formerly ' ' Boophilus microplus ' ' ) . In 2007 , the sequence of its genome was announced . Measuring 8.2 million base pairs , its genome is remarkably similar to the genome of ' ' Theileria parva ' ' , the cause of East Coast fever ( theileriosis ) in cattle . # Infection # ' ' Babesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs , and can remain resident in tick populations for up to four years without infecting a vertebrate host . More commonly , a larval tick feeds upon a domestic cow , an African buffalo or a water buffalo , releasing the parasites into the animal 's bloodstream . The involvement of the larval stage of the ticks in the cycle is specific to ' ' B. bovis ' ' ; other ' ' Babesia ' ' species only involve adult ticks . The parasites then invade individual red blood cells , multiplying and destroying the host cells until the animal is stricken with hemolytic anemia . Adult ticks which feed upon infected cattle are infected themselves , completing the cycle . In humans , infection is rare and usually only affects splenectomized patients . # References
