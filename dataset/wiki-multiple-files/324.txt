Developed in response to a government-sponsored competition in support of the new doctrine of aerial first aid , it was employed exclusively in the overseas colonies , specifically Morocco and Syria . Unlike the MB.80 prototype , the MB.81 had a closed cockpit and a somewhat larger cargo space . This was the company 's first design which made it out of prototyping. # History # The aircraft was designed to be able to seek patients or casualties by scouting , even at high altitudes , during military operations in mountainous countries , like then-French Morocco over the Atlas Mountains . The main design feature made it possible to transport a casualty lying prone , in a compartment placed between the pilot and the engine .

The aircraft was built without any assistance from the government , but an initial order of 20 was placed by the Ground French Forces ( the French Arme de l'Air was founded in 1933 ) , and it was one of the aircraft that relaunched Marcel Bloch in the aeronautical construction industry . The production model , called the MB.81 , was fitted with a French Salmson 9Nd of 128.68 kW ( 175 hp ) . It took part in military operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930s .
