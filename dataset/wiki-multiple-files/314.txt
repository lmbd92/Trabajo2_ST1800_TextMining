@@937514 SURAnet was a pioneer in scientific computer networks and one of the regional backbone computer networks that made up the National Science Foundation Network ( NSFNET ) . Many of the Internet communications standards and protocols as we know it today were developed by SURAnet. # How SURAnet started # By the mid-1980s it was clear that access to high-capacity computer resources would be needed to facilitate scientific collaboration among the Southeastern Universities Research Association ( SURA ) member institutions . A high-performance network to provide this access was essential , but no single institution could afford to develop such a system . SURA stepped up to the challenge and , with support from the U.S. National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and SURA universities , SURAnet was up and running in 1987 , and was part of the first phase of National Science Foundation Network ( NSFNET ) funding as the agency built a network to facilitate scientific collaboration . SURAnet was one of the first and one of the largest Internet providers in the United States . SURA sites first used a 56 kbit/s backbone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1989 , and to a 45 Mbit/s ( DS3 ) backbone in 1991 . FIX East and MAE-East , both major peering points , were located at the main SURA facilities . Large-scale collaboration among SURA-affiliated scientists became an everyday reality . # Role of SURAnet in the development of the Internet # SURAnet participated in the development of Internet communications standards and telecommunications protocols that enabled researchers and federal agencies to communicate and work in this early Internet environment . SURAnet was one of the first NSFNET regional networks to become operational . SURAnet provided networking services for universities and industry , and was one of the first TCP/IP networks to sell commercial connections , when IBM Research in Raleigh-Durham , North Carolina was connected in 1987-1988 . It was also the first network to attempt to convert to OSPF in 1990. # Beyond SURAnet # SURAnet was so successful that it outgrew SURA 's primary mission , and the SURA Board approved its sale to Bolt , Beranek and Newman in 1995 . Many of the protocols and procedures created under SURAnet are still in use in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the information technology community , participating in projects such as XSEDE , Earthcube , and AtlanticWave.
