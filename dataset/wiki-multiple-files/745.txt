@@3246514 ECW ( Enhanced Compression Wavelet ) is a proprietary wavelet compression image format optimized for aerial and satellite imagery . It was developed by Earth Resource Mapping , and is now owned by Intergraph . The lossy compression format efficiently compresses very large images with fine alternating contrast while retaining their visual quality . In 1998 ER Mapper Ltd in Perth , Western Australia company founder Stuart Nixon , and two software developers Simon Cope and Mark Sheridan were researching rapid delivery of terabyte sized images over the internet using inexpensive server technology . The outcome of that research was two products , Image Web Server ( IWS ) and ECW . ECW represented a fundamental mathematical breakthrough enabling Discrete Wavelet Transforms ( DWT ) and inverse-DWT operations to be performed on very large images very quickly , while only using a tiny amount of RAM . For ECW patents , see and . For IWS patent , see . These patents were assigned to ERDAS ( under a former name of Leica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging ) July 29 , 2007 . After JPEG2000 became an image standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data into the ECW SDK to form the ECW JPEG2000 SDK . After subsequent purchase by ERDAS ( themselves subsequently merged into Intergraph ) , the software development kit was renamed to the ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK. of the SDK was released on 2 July 2013. # Properties # Map projection information can be embedded into the ECW file format to support geospatial applications . Image data of up to 65,535 bands ( layers or colors ) can be compressed into the ECW v2 file format at a rate of over 25 MB per second on an i7 740QM ( 4-cores ) 1.731 GHz processor using v4.2 of the ECW/JP2 SDK . Data flow compression allows for compression of large images with small RAM requirements . The file format can achieve typical compression ratios from 1:2 to 1:100 . The ECW Protocol ( ECWP ) is an efficient streaming protocol used to transmit ECW and JPEG2000 images over networks , such as the Internet . ECWP supports ECWPS for private and secure encrypted streaming of image data over public networks such as the Internet . There is a very fast read-only SDK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for desktop implementation ( Microsoft Windows only ) . A read / write SDK can be prchased for desktop and server implementations ( Windows , Linux and Mac OS ) . A full functioning server implementation ( using ECW , JPEG2000 , ECWP and JPIP ) is available with an ( formerly IWS ) license . A previous version of the SDK ( 3.3 ) is available in open source , and can be used for non-Microsoft operating systems , such as Linux , MacOs or Android . # References # **14;223398;references
