@@5678514 The Decadent movement was a late 19th-century artistic and literary movement of Western Europe . It flourished in France , but also had devotees in England and throughout Europe , as well as in the United States . # Overview # Decadence was the name given , originally by hostile critics , to several late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice more than the earlier Romantics ' nave descriptions . Some of them adopted the name , referring to themselves as Decadents . For the most part , they were influenced by the tradition of Gothic novels and by the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe , and were associated with Symbolism and/or Aestheticism . During the 1880s a group of French writers referred to themselves as Decadents . The classic novel from this group is Joris-Karl Huysmans ' ' ' Against Nature ' ' ( 1884 ) , often considered the first great decadent work , though others attribute this honour to Baudelaire 's works . Prominent scholars of Decadence , such as David Weir , now regard Decadence as a transition between Romanticism and Modernism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Oscar Wilde , Aubrey Beardsley and some artists and writers associated with ' ' The Yellow Book ' ' . In the United States , the brothers Edgar and Francis Saltus wrote decadent fiction and poetry . Symbolism has often been confused with Decadence . Several young writers were referred to derisively in the press as decadent during the mid-1880s . Jean Moras ' manifesto was largely a response to this polemic . A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it . Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be considered to be similar in some respects , the two remain distinct . Max Nordau wrote a bestselling attack on the movement , ' ' Degeneration ' ' ( 1892 ) . A detailed study of the movement which attracted wide attention was ' ' The Romantic Agony ' ' ( 1933 ) by Mario Praz. # Artists and writers # * Peter Altenberg * Gabriele d'Annunzio * Konstantin Balmont * David Park Barnitz * Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly * Charles Baudelaire * Franz von Bayros * Aubrey Beardsley * Max Beerbohm * Jan Frans De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chambers * Ernest Dowson * Zinaida Gippius * Remy de Gourmont * Guido Gozzano * Joris-Karl Huysmans * Vojislav Ili * Alfred Kubin * Comte de Lautramont * Jane de La Vaudre * Richard le Gallienne * Jean Lorrain * Arthur Machen * Dmitry Merezhkovsky * Nikolai Minsky * Octave Mirbeau * Robert de Montesquiou * George Moore * Gustave Moreau * Edvard Munch * Grard de Nerval * Vincent OSullivan * Rachilde * Odilon Redon * Charles Ricketts * Arthur Rimbaud * Georges Rodenbach * Frederick Rolfe * Flicien Rops * Arthur Schnitzler * Marcel Schwob * M.P .
