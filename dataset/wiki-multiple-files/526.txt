ICD10 = ICD9 = 78.1 , 79,93.51-93.56 , 93.59 MeshID = D016267 OPS301 = OtherCodes = HCPCSlevel2 = External fixation is a surgical treatment used to stabilize bone and soft tissues at a distance from the operative or injury focus . They provide unobstructed access to the relevant skeletal and soft tissue structures for their initial assessment and also for secondary interventions needed to restore bony continuity and a functional soft tissue cover . Parts of an external fixator includes 1. schanz pin , 2. connecting rods , 3 . Clamps. # Indications # # Stabilization of severe open fractures # Stabilization of infected nonunions # Correction of extremity malalignments and length discrepancies # Initial stabilization of soft tissue and bony disruption in poly trauma patients ( damage control orthopaedics ) # Closed fracture with associated severe soft tissue injuries # Severely comminuted diaphyseal and periarticular lesions # Temporary transarticular stabilization of severe soft tissue and ligamentous injuries # Pelvic ring disruptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open fractures that have significant soft tissue disruption ( eg , type II or III open fractures ) Soft tissue injury ( eg , burns ) Acetabular and pelvic fractures Severely comminuted and unstable fractures Fractures that are associated with bony deficits Limb-lengthening procedures Fractures associated with infection or nonunion # Contraindications # # Patient with compromised immune system # Non compliant patient who would not be able to ensure proper wire and pin care # Pre-existing internal fixation that prohibits proper wire or pin placement # Bone pathology precluding pin fixation # Method # In this kind of reduction , holes are drilled into uninjured areas of bones around the fracture and special bolts or wires are screwed into the holes . Outside the body , a rod or a curved piece of metal with special ball-and-socket joints joins the bolts to make a rigid support . The fracture can be set in the proper anatomical configuration by adjusting the ball-and-socket joints . Since the bolts pierce the skin , proper cleaning to prevent infection at the site of surgery must be performed . Installation of the external fixator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Removal of the external frame and bolts usually requires special wrenches and can be done with no anesthesia in an office visit . External fixation is usually used when internal fixation is contraindicated- often to treat open fractures , or as a temporary solution . External fixation is also used in limb lengthening . People with short limbs can have , for example , legs lengthened . In most cases the thigh bone ( femur ) is cut diagonally in a surgical procedure under anesthesia . External fixator pins or wires ( as above ) are placed each side of the ' man made fracture ' and the external metal apparatus is used to very gradually push the two sides of the bone apart millimetre by millimetre day by day and week by week . Bone will gradually grow into the small gap created by this ' distraction ' technique . Such a process can take many months . In most cases it may be necessary for the external fixator to be in place for many weeks or even months . Most fractures heal in between 6 and 12 weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with the healing of the fracture this may take longer still . It is known that bearing weight through fracture by walking on it , for example , with the added support of the external fixator frame actually helps fractures to heal . # History # Almost 2400 years ago Hippocrates described a form of external fixation to splint a fracture of the tibia . The device consisted of closely fitting proximal and distal Egyptian leather rings connected by four wooden rods from a cornel tree . In 1840 , Jean-Francois Malgaigne described a spike driven into the tibia and held by straps to immobilise a fractured tibia . In 1843 he used a claw-like device to percutaneously hold the fragments of a fractured patella . Clayton Parkhill of Denver , Colorado and Albine Lambotte of Antwerp , Belgium independently invented the modern concept of unilateral external fixation , in 1894 and 1902 , respectively . Lambotte was the first to use threaded pins , however , his device necessitated initial , open fracture reduction and then pin insertion and fixator placement . In 1938 , Raoul Hoffmann of Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that major improvements were essential to make the external fixator more clinically relevant . He developed a technique based on closed reduction with guided percutaneous pin placement . Hoffmanns technique exemplified the first application of minimally invasive orthopaedic surgery . In the 1950s , Gavriil Ilizarov of Kurgan , Soviet Union , devised and developed a new method for treating fractures , deformities and other bone defects . A metal frame that encircles the limb is attached to the underlying bone by crossing ( X ) pins inserted through the bone and limb . The external rings are linked to each other by threaded rods and hinges that allow to move the position of the bone fragments without opening the fracture site , then the fragments can be fixed in rigid position until complete healing . # Types # *Ilizarov apparatus *Taylor Spatial Frame *Hoffmann external fixation system *Rail external fixator
