@@6070514 Haderslevhus ( or Hansborg ) is the name of a castle that once stood in the Danish city of Haderslev , until destroyed by a fire . # History # Like most of the medieval cities of trade , Haderslev had a royal castle , which was called Haderslevhus . The suffix hus ( meaning house ) was commonly used for castles in medieval Denmark ( Koldinghus , Tnderhus , lborghus , Riberhus etc . ) . The castle was first mentioned in sources dating back to 1326 , but it is it was most likely built in the second half of the 13th century , like most Danish city castles . These were home of the governor of the borough ( and later the county ) , who took care of the king 's ( or in Southern Jutland , the duke 's ) possessions in and around the city . In the city castle , the taxes , duties , and fines were paid . Haderslevhus was located in the eastern part of the city , which was surrounded by a moat at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he imposed the Reformation in Haderslev , in 1526 . When Hans the Elder was proclaimed duke of Slesvig and Holstein ( today Southern Jutland and Northern Germany ) , he took up residence in Haderslevhus , which now , in 1544 , was an old , and worn-out building . After a few years , the duke decided to build a new castle , called Hansburger . It was supposed to be a new and modern renaissance palace that suited him much better . As chief architect , he appointed Hercules von Oberberg - one of the most influential architects of the time . The western wing of the building was ready for use in 1562 and the duke moved in . Four years later , in 1566 , the southern wing with the chappelle was completed . After the completion of Hansborg , the old building was demolished , and the area on which it stood for centuries , was sold in bits to the staff of the new palace . A small part of the castle is preserved to this day . In the 1570s , Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hansborg , but he died in 1580 , and therefore did not see the completed castle . After the duke died , the Danish King Frederik the 2nd acquired parts of his lands , including Haderslev , and in 1580-1585 he finished the construction of the last two wings . The palace now stood as a whole - complete with four wings and two towers at the corners . In the area between the castle and the city , one could find stables , economic buildings , and residences for parts of the palace staff . The palace itself spanned over a 80x75m piece of ground - about the size of Kronborg , and a bit bigger than Snderborg Castle . Shortly after the completion of Hansborg , it was decided that the castle should be called by the original name , Haderslevhus -- presumably to follow the old systematic naming of castles in trade cities at the time . So , actually , the castle was only called Hansborg in the short period of time between 1562 to about 1590 . Otherwise , the castles has always been spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle as headquarters in 1627-1629 , and the building was severely damaged . In 1629-1642 a lot of reconstruction took place , but the castle was invaded by Torstenson 's troops in 1643-1645 , and in 1644 , the castle caught fire , and burned to the ground . After this catastrophe , many of the bricks was used for the construction of the Danish Royal Library , and therefore a castle was never rebuilt . Haderslev had lost both of its castles .
