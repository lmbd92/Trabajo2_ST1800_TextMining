@@425514 Art theft is usually for the purpose of resale or for ransom ( sometimes called artnapping ) . Stolen art is sometimes used by criminals as collateral to secure loans . Only a small percentage of stolen art is recoveredestimates range from 5 to 10% . This means that little is known about the scope and characteristics of art theft . # Individual theft # Many thieves are motivated by the fact that valuable art pieces are worth millions of dollars and weigh only a few kilograms at most . Transport for items such as paintings is also trivial , assuming the thief is willing to inflict some damage to the painting by cutting it off the frame and rolling it up into a tube carrier . Also , while most high-profile museums have extremely tight security , many places with multimillion art collections works have disproportionately poor security measures . That makes them susceptible to thefts that are slightly more complicated than a typical smash-and-grab , but offer a huge potential payoff . For those with substantial collections , such as the Marquess of Cholmondeley at Houghton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiable . Jean-Baptiste Oudry 's ' ' White Duck ' ' was stolen from the Cholmondeley collection at Houghton Hall in 1990 .

C. The conference is aimed at professionals in the field of cultural property protection . Since 1996 , the Netherlands-based Museum Security Network has disseminated news and information related to issues of cultural property loss and recovery . Since its founding the Museum Security Network has collected and disseminated over 45,000 reports about incidents with cultural property .

ARCA is a nonprofit think tank dedicated principally to raising the profile of art crime ( art forgery and vandalism , as well as theft ) as an academic subject . Since 2009 , ARCA has offered a postgraduate certificate program dedicated to this field of study . The Postgraduate Certificate Program in Art Crime and Cultural Heritage Protection is held from June to August every year in Italy . # Recovery # In the public sphere , Interpol , the FBI Art Crime Team , London 's Metropolitan Police , New York Police Department 's special frauds squad and a number of other law enforcement agencies worldwide maintain squads dedicated to investigating thefts of this nature and recovering stolen works of art . According to Robert King Wittman , a former FBI agent who led the Art Crime Team until his retirement in 2008 , the unit is very small compared with similar law-enforcement units in Europe , and most art thefts investigated by the FBI involve agents at local offices who handle routine property theft .

Hermann Gring , head of the Luftwaffe , personally took charge of hundreds of valuable pieces , generally stolen from Jews and other victims of the Holocaust . In early 2011 , about 1,500 art masterpieces , assumed to have been stolen by the Nazis during and before World War II , were confiscated from a private home in Munich , Germany . The confiscation was not made public until November 2013 . With an estimated value of $1 billion , their discovery is considered astounding , and includes works by Pablo Picasso , Henri Matisse , Marc Chagall , Paul Klee , Max Beckmann and Emil Nolde , all of which were considered lost . The looted , mostly Modernist art , was banned by the Nazis when they came to power , on the grounds that it was un-German or Jewish Bolshevist in nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Nazis may be able to claim ownership of many of the works . Members of the families of the original owners of these artworks have , in many cases , persisted in claiming title to their pre-war property . The 1964 film ' ' The Train ' ' , starring Burt Lancaster , is based on the true story of works of art which had been placed in storage for protection in France during the war , but was looted by the Germans from French museums and private art collections , to be shipped by train back to Germany . Another film , ' ' The Monuments Men ' ' ( 2014 ) , co-produced , co-written and directed by George Clooney , is based on a similar true-life story . In this film , U.S. soldiers are tasked with saving over a million pieces of art and other culturally important items throughout Europe , before their destruction by Nazi plunder . In 2006 , after a protracted court battle in the United States and Austria ( see Republic of Austria v. Altmann ) , five paintings by Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niece of pre-war owner , Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer . Two of the paintings were portraits of Altmann 's aunt , Adele . The more famous of the two , the gold ' ' Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I ' ' , was sold in 2006 by Altmann and her co-heirs to philanthropist Ronald Lauder for $135 million . At the time of the sale , it was the highest known price ever paid for a painting . The remaining four restituted paintings were later sold at Christie 's New York for over $190 million . Because antiquities are often regarded by the country of origin as national treasures , there are numerous cases where artworks ( often displayed in the acquiring country for decades ) have become the subject of highly charged and political controversy . One prominent example is the case of the Elgin Marbles , which were moved from Greece to the British Museum in 1816 by Thomas Bruce , 7th Earl of Elgin . Many different Greek governments have maintained that removal was tantamount to theft . Similar controversies have arisen over Etruscan , Aztec , and Italian artworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the removal of artifacts is a pernicious form of cultural imperialism . Yale University 's Peabody Museum of Natural History is engaged ( as of November 2006 ) in talks with the government of Peru about possible repatriation of artifacts taken during the excavation of Machu Picchu by Yale 's Hiram Bingham . In 2006 , New York 's Metropolitan Museum reached an agreement with Italy to return many disputed pieces . The Getty Museum in Los Angeles is also involved in a series of cases of this nature . The artwork in question is of Greek and ancient Italian origin . The museum agreed on November 20 , 2006 , to return 26 contested pieces to Italy . One of the Getty 's signature pieces , a statue of the goddess Aphrodite , is the subject of particular scrutiny . # Famous cases of art theft # # Notable unrecovered works # Images of some artworks that have been stolen and have not yet been recovered . <gallery> Image:Ghent Altarpiece E - Just Judges by Vanderveken.jpgJan van Eyck : ' ' The Just Judges ' ' Image:Vermeer The concert.JPGJohannes Vermeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ File:Rembrandt Christ in the Storm on the Lake of Galilee.jpgRembrandt : ' ' The Storm on the Sea of Galilee ( 1633 ) ' ' Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 076. jpgGovaert Flinck , until recently attributed to Rembrandt : ' ' Landscape with an Obelisk ( 1638 ) ' ' Image:Cholmondeley Oudry White Duck.jpgJean-Baptiste Oudry : ' ' The White Duck ( 1753 ) ' ' File:Picasso - Le pigeon aux petits pois 1911. jpgPablo Picasso : ' ' Le pigeon aux petits pois ( 1911 ) ' ' File:Amedeo Modigliani 028. jpgAmedeo Modigliani : ' ' ( 1919 ) ' ' File:Van Gogh - Die Kirche von Nuenen mit Kirchgngern.jpegVincent van Gogh : ' ' Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen ' ' ( 1884 ) File:Van Gogh - Strand von Scheveningen bei strmischen Wetter.jpegVincent van Gogh : ' ' View of the Sea at Scheveningen ' ' ( 1882 ) File:Caspar David Friedrich 027. jpgCaspar David Friedrich : ' ' Landschaft mit Regenbogen ' ' , ( ' ' Landscape with rainbow ' ' ) ( ca 1810 ) File:Franz Marc 029a.jpgFranz Marc : ' ' The Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) File:Carl Spitzweg 030. jpgCarl Spitzweg : ' ' Der Liebesbrief ' ' 1845-1846 ( missing since 1989 ) </gallery> # Fictional art theft # Genres such as crime fiction often portray fictional art thefts as glamorous or exciting .
