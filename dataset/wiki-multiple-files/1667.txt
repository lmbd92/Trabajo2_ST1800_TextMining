The site is 1.88 km2. i Units 3 and 4 were Japan 's the last operating nuclear power plants . # Reactors on site # # History # # December 2005 # On 22 December 2005 , at 8:50am there was trouble with a power line due to strong winds and heavy snow , the reactor was shut down as a result . # July 2011 # On 15 July 2011 , Kansai Electric announced that two more nuclear power reactors in Fukui Prefecture would be shut down for regular inspections . The result of this decision was that 6 reactors were shut down , over half the utility 's 11 reactors . The No. 4 reactor of the plant in Takahama Town will be brought to a halt for regular inspections on 21 July , and the No. 4 reactor of the plant in Oh Town , on 22 July . Regular inspections are nearly complete at two other reactors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress tests for the nation 's nuclear plants leaves it unclear when they could be brought back on line . On 15 July 2011 , the pressure in a tank with boric-acid dropped unexpectedly . This tank injects water into the reactor in the event of an emergency . This made it impossible to inject water in a proper way into the No. 1 reactor . The reactor would be manually shut down around 9 PM on 16 July to look into the cause of the problem , although pressure returned to normal in about one hour . It was said that the trouble did not cause any leak of radioactive substances to the outside . # August 2011 # In August 2011 citizens of the prefecture Shiga , at the banks of Lake Biwa , started a lawsuit at the Otsu District Court , and asked a court order to prevent the restart of seven reactors operated by Kansai Electric Power Company , in the prefecture Fukui. # December 2011 # On 16 December 2011 Kansai Electric Power Company halted the No.2 reactor for a 4-month safety check . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no. 3 and no. 4 were approved after a meeting on 9 February 2012 of a panel of nuclear experts . The report said that the tests on the reactors were conducted appropriately and measures for earthquakes and tsunami were in place at the plant . These results would be submitted to NISA as early as 13 February 2012 , after the briefing of minister Yukio Edano of Economy , Trade and Industry . But the local governments of the prefecture Fukui and the town i were still very cautious about restarting the reactors , to their minds the stress tests had little priority , and they urged the central government to create new safety standards based on the lessons learned after accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. # March 2012 # On 29 March 2012 the governor Keiji Yamada of Kyoto said to the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency that the prefecture would not accept the restart of reactor 3 and 4 at the i nuclear power plant . Officials of the agency did visit Kyoto , to explain that the stress tests on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shiga Yukiko Kada , who was visited later for a likewise explanation , reacted in a similar way : he asked for no hasty decisions . Although the approval of local governments was not legally required , prime minister Noda had made it clear , that the participation of the local communities would be taken into account . Mayor Yamada of Kyoto , with some 67,000 people living in areas within a radius of 30 kilometers from the i power plant , added to his statement : ' ' A safety standard that reflects technical knowledge learned from the accident at Tokyo Electric 's Fukushima Daiichi power plant must be presented first . ' ' # April 2012 # To improve the safety at the plant an action plan was designed with a total of 91 possible measures . On 9 April 2012 of this only 54 were already implemented : the earthquake resistance of the power transmission towers was improved , satellite telephone communication was installed , seawater could be taken in to cool the systems . But an earthquake-resistant office building was not to be completed before April 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central control room would act as emergency-management office . Because this place offers only accommodation for some 50 people , experts had doubts about this place . Venting systems to release steam from the containment with filters to remove radioactive isotopes were planned to be built in 2015 . The dam that would offer better protection against tsunamis was to be finished around March 2014 . On 13 April 2012 at a meeting of the Japanese government the stress-tests of two reactors of the i nuclear plant and the safety action plan submitted by KEPCO were approved satisfactory and conform safety standards . To prevent the rise of electricity charges and an estimated power shortage of 18% in the summer of 2012 the two reactors needed to be restarted . Industry minister Yukio Edano said , that the 2 reactors were safe enough to be restarted and there was a need for their resumption . # May 2012 # On 1 May 2012 Tetsuya Yamamoto , head of the nuclear crisis management team of NISA , said at a meeting at the Kyoto prefectural hall , that the Japanese government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be involved with this . The head of the Kyoto crisis team , did not accept this explanation , and said that the government explanation is inconsistent with the demands of local people . On 14 May 2012 Oi assembly says yes to restarting reactors . The assembly made the decision in consideration of the economic damage that a prolonged suspension could cause and conveyed its view to Oi Mayor Shinobu Tokioka later in the day . The mayor was set to make a decision on whether to approve the restarts after reflecting on the assembly 's conclusion and the results of the appraisal made by Fukui 's nuclear safety commission and other matters . The decision will then be conveyed to Fukui Gov . Issei Nishikawa . The assembly 's decision followed an 11-1 vote in favor of restarting the reactors . One assembly member was absent due to illness . # July 2012 # Reactor #3 was restarted on 1 July and reached criticality on 2 July 2012 . On 11 July 2012 Kansai Electric announced that reactor#4 was to be reactivated . The control rods would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the next morning . Power generation started on 21 July . The reactor could function on full output capacity on 25 July . # September 2012 # The city and prefecture of Osaka requested that both units 3 and 4 be shut down , stating that the power was not needed . # October/November 2012 # On 29 October 2012 Kansai Electric Power Co. announced in an interim report , that the F-6 fault running north-south between the plants Nos. 1-2 reactors and Nos. 3-4 reactors was found to be not active . Digging and boring surveys gave no indication of danger . According to Mitsuhisa Watanabe , tectonic geomorphology professor at Tokyo University , the fault poses security risks when the nuclear reactors continue to operate , and the seismic threat was underestimated by the authorities . An on-site inspection by the Nuclear Regulation Authority was scheduled for 2 November 2012. # March 2013 # On 19 March 2013 the NRA announced that it would check the power plant on the site according to the new safety standards , before their introduction in July 2013 , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , than continued operation until September would be authorized by the NRA . After this date the reactors needed their routine maintenance . The NRA expected that the No. 3 and 4 reactors at the Oi plant would be able to clear most of the new safety standards , because countermeasures were in place . But the NRA intended to do a close examination . # June 2013 # In the first weeks of June 2013 a team of inspectors , including NRA Commissioner Toyoshi Fuketa , examined the two operating reactors . # July 2013 # On 3 July 2013 the NRA allowed the plant to keep the two operating reactors on line , although on 8 July new safety requirements for atomic plants would take effect . The NRA saw no serious problems at that moment . After September because of the mandatory routine checks the reactors would be taken offline . To resume operations , the reactors needed to comply with the new requirements , including the absence of active faults under the plant . Half July the outcome of the latest trench survey was expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unit 3 at the Ohi nuclear power plant in Japan was shut down on 3 September 2013 On 14 September 2013 , the day before the no. 4 Oi reactor was scheduled to closed down for regular inspections , some 9000 demonstrators gathered at the Kameido Chuo Park and later marched close to JR Kinshicho Station and the Tokyo Skytree . They called for an end of Japan 's dependency on nuclear power . The day after the Oi-reactor closed down , leaving Japan without any nuclear power for the third time in 40 years . # May 2014 # The Fukui District Court rules that it will not allow the restart of the Oi no.3 and no.4 reactors . <ref> cite web url=http : **85;2473;TOOLONG
