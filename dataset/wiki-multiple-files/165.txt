It was formed from the ' ' Independent Unionist Group ' ' operating in the Shankill area of Belfast , becoming the PUP in 1979 .

This was followed by a poor showing in the Northern Ireland local election of 2005 , where Smyth and Ervine were their only two members to retain their seats on local authorities , and the party now seems to be in a state of decline .
