@@1560514 Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Yusuf ibn Ibrahim ibn Tammam al-Siddiq Al-Baghdadi ( 835912 ) , known in the West by his Latinized name Hametus , was an Arab mathematician , like his father Yusuf ibn Ibrahim ( ) . # Life # Ahmad ibn Yusuf was born in Baghdad and moved with his father to Damascus in 839 . He later moved to Cairo , but the exact date is unknown : since he was also known as ' ' al-Misri ' ' , which means ' ' the Egyptian ' ' , this probably happened at an early age . Eventually , he also died in Cairo . He probably grew up in a strongly intellectual environment : his father worked on Mathematics , Astronomy and Medicine , produced astronomical tables and was a member of a group of scholars . He achieved an important role in Egypt , which was caused by Egypt 's relative independence from the Abbasid Caliph . # Work # In some of the works attributed to Ahmad , it is not clear if the text came from him , his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that he worked on a book on ratio and proportion . This was translated to Latin by Gherard of Cremona and was a commentary of Euclid 's ' ' Elements ' ' . This book influenced early European mathematicians such as Fibonacci . Further , in ' ' On similar arcs ' ' , he commented on Ptolemy 's ' ' Karpos ' ' ( or ' ' Centiloquium ' ' ) ; many scholars believe that ibn Yusuf was in fact the true author of that work . He also wrote a book on the astrolabe . He invented methods to solve tax problems that were later presented in Fibonacci 's ' ' Liber Abaci ' ' . He was also quoted by mathematicians such as Thomas Bradwardine , Jordanus de Nemore and Luca Pacioli. # Notes #
