@@1721514 ' ' Comes ' ' ( ) , plural ' ' comites ' ' ( ) , is the Latin word for companion , either individually or as a member of a collective known as ' ' comitatus ' ' , especially the suite of a magnate , in some cases large and/or formal enough to have a specific name , such as a ' ' cohors amicorum . ' ' The word ' ' comes ' ' derives from ' ' com- ' ' with + ' ' ire ' ' go . # Ancient Roman religion # ' ' Comes ' ' was a common epithet or title , added to the name ( as Catholicism still does with Jesus and much-venerated saints , such as in Our Lady of Lourdes ) for a hero or a divinity , as a way to mark a relationship with another divinity . On Constantine I 's coinage , the emperor is declared ' ' comes ' ' to Sol Invictus , the Unconquered Sun conceived of as a god . # Imperially bestowed court titles and various offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' became a secular title given to trusted ( ex- ) courtiers and others , as a mark of imperial confidence , developing into a formal rank , deriving from the Companions of Alexander the Great and rather equivalent to the Hellenistic ' ' Philos ( Basilikos ) ' ' or the paladin title of a Holy Roman Empire knight and a papal official , and therefore the title was retained when one was appointed -- often promoted -- to a post away from court , often in the field or provincial administration ; next , it seemed logical to link it to specific charges calling for an incumbent of high rank , and even to make it part of the official title . As the imperial court grew in size and assimilated to itself all political influence , the emperors established a casual practice of appointing loyal servants to various posts . This process had already been utilized elsewhere , as with the Prefect of the Praetorian Guard and the Amici Principis . As the imperial system expanded , however , new offices were needed and decentralization demanded change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . The ' ' comites ' ' ( often translated as counts , though neither feudal nor hereditary ) became leading officials of the later Roman Empire . They wielded posts of every description , from the army to the civil service , while never surrendering their direct links and access to the emperors . Constantine took the final step of certifying the posts , as ' ' comites provinciarum ' ' , counts of the provinces , who were sent out alongside vicars in their dioceses so that they were permanent fixtures of imperial government . They are listed in full for the beginning of the fifth century in the Notitia dignitatum , and a schematic map of comital military posts in English translation is available at the Friesian project . At later dates , additional posts have been created . The following are examples of the various types of ' ' comites ' ' # At court or in the imperial domains # Several of the major departments of an imperial court and household had a chief styled ' ' comes ' ' , with an ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a governor . These included : * ' ' Comes dispositonum ' ' A deputy to the very powerful ' ' magister officiorum ' ' ( master of offices ) ; responsible for organizing the imperial calendar and preparing the correspondence for distribution to the proper offices for transcription . * ' ' Comes domesticorum ' ' -a ' ' vir illustris ' ' - Head of the Domestici , a corps of bodyguards of the emperor who were stationed in the imperial palace . There were two of these comital commanders , for the horse - viz. foot units ( ' ' Comes domesticorum Equitum ' ' vs . ' ' Comes domesticorum Peditum ' ' ) . * ' ' Comes privatae largitionis ' ' Keeper of the privy purse , answerable and subordinate to the ' ' comes rerum privatarum ' ' . * ' ' Comes rerum privatarum ' ' Powerful imperial officer responsible for the private estates or holdings of the emperor and his family ( ' ' res privata ' ' ) .

He controlled all of the mints ( each led by a Procurator ) , was in chief of a long list of officials ( more Procurators , rationales , Praepositi ) who collected senatorial taxes , custom duties and some land taxes , was also responsible for the yields of the mines , provided budgets for the civil service and armies and supplied all uniforms . His competence also included several minor Comites : ** ' ' Comes Auri ' ' ' gold count ' ** ' ' Comes sacrae vestis ' ' Master of the wardrobe of the emperor . **three regional ' ' comites largitionum ' ' : for Italy , Africa , Illyricum **a ' ' comes commerciorum ' ' for Illyricum. **a ' ' comes metallorum per Illyricum ' ' , responsible for the region 's gold mines Exceptionally , a gubernatorial position was styled ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Actually one of the ' ' vicarii ' ' , this count had control over the large and strategically important imperial diocese of the East , supervising the governors of this major group of provinces , but was himself under supervision of the ' ' praefectus praetorio Orientis ' ' . Furthermore , some less important section chiefs under the authority of otherwise styled , high-ranking territorial officials could be styled Comes , e.g. under the ' ' praefectus urbis ' ' of Rome ( a ' ' vir illustris ' ' ) were a ' ' comes formarum ' ' , a ' ' comes riparum et alvei Tiberis et cloacarum ' ' ( count of the coast of the Tiber and the canalisation ) and a ' ' comes portus ' ' ( count of the port ) . The title ' ' comes consistorianus ' ' indicated the ' ' comites ' ' who advised the Emperor in his council ( the ' ' consistorium ' ' ) for official ( mainly legal ) matters , whether on an occasional basis , ' ' ex officio ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of his ' ' adsessor ' ' ( ' chief counsel ' ) , as a distinct job . # Comes rei militaris # These comites held military appointments , higher than dux , but under Magister peditum/ Magister equitum ; they were the superiors of a series of military posts , each commanded by a praepositus limitis ( border commander ) , and/or unit commanders , such as tribunes of cohorts , ' ' alae ' ' ( auxiliary equivalent ) , ' ' numeri ' ' , in the eastern empire even legions : The Notitia Dignitatum ( early fifth century ) mentions six such positions , of the rank vir spectabilis , in the western empire ( Comes Italiae , Comes Africae , Comes Tingitaniae , Comes Tractus Argentoratensis , Comes Britanniarum and Litoris Saxonici per Britanniam ) and two in the eastern empire : Comes ( limitis ) Aegypti , Comes Isauriae = - per Isauria ) . * ' ' Comes Africae ' ' Count in charge of the defense of Roman Africa . * ' ' Comes Argentoratensis ' ' Count in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . * ' ' Comes Avernorum ' ' Count in charge of the defense of part of Gaul ( Gallia ) . * ' ' Comes Britanniarum ' ' Count in charge of defense of Roman Britain ( Britannia ) . This post presumably expired circa AD 410 , when the last Roman troops left the isles forever . ** ' ' Comes Littoris Saxonici per Britanniam ' ' * ' ' Comes Hispaniarum ' ' Count in charge of the defense of Roman Iberia ( Hispania ) . As the number of comites grew , the rank was devalued , which led to he introduction of the notion of classes of comites ; first , second and third ' ' ordines ' ' # Horse guards corps of Comites # The ' ' Comites dominorum nostrorum ' ' ( plural of ' ' Comes D.N. ; ' ' literally Companions of our Lords Emperors ' ) were a mounted imperial body guard during Diocletian 's tetrarchy ( c. 300 ) . # Medieval usages # # Gothic Comites # The Goths that ruled Spain and Italy followed the tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diverse heads of the departments of the royal household . *Comes CubiculariorumCount in charge of the chamberlains ( L. cubicularii ) . *Comes ScanciorumCount in charge of the cup-bearers *Comes StabulorumCount in charge of the equerries and stables *Comes NotariorumCount in charge of the chancery *Comes ThesaurorumCount in charge of the officers of the treasury *etc. # Frankish Gaugraf # The Frankish kings of the Merovingian dynasty retained a good deal of the Roman system of administration , including the title ' ' comes ' ' preserved its original meaning : a companion of the king , a royal servant of high rank . Under the early Frankish kings some ' ' comites ' ' did not exercise any definite functions ; they were merely attached to the king 's person and executed his orders . Others filled the highest offices , e.g. the ' ' comes palatii ' ' and ' ' comes stabuli ' ' ( survives in the title Constable ) . The kingdom was divided for administrative purposes into small areas called ' ' pagi ' ' ( hence French ' ' pays ' ' ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Roman ' ' civitas ' ' . At the head of the pagus was the ' ' comes ' ' , corresponding to the German Graf ( in full ' ' Gaugraf ' ' ) . The ' ' comes ' ' was appointed by the king and removable at his pleasure , and was chosen originally from all classes , sometimes from enfranchised serfs . His essential functions were judicial and executive , and in documents he is often described as the kings agent ( ' ' agens publicus ' ' ) or royal judge ( ' ' judex publicus/fiscalis ' ' ) . As the delegate of the executive power he had the right to military command in the king 's name , and to take all the measures necessary for the preservation of the peace , i.e. to exercise the royal ban ( ' ' bannus regis ' ' ) . He was at once public prosecutor and judge , was responsible for the execution of the sentences of the courts , and as the king 's representative exercised the royal right of protection ( ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , orphans and the like . He enjoyed a triple wergeld , but had no definite salary , being remunerated by the receipt of certain revenues , a system which contained the germs of discord , on account of the confusion of his public and private duties . The Anglo-Saxon ' ' gerefa ' ' , however , meaning ' ' illustrious , chief ' ' , has apparently , according to philologists , no connection with the German ' ' Graf ' ' , which originally meant servant ( compare the origins of the words knight or valet ) . It is the more curious that the ' ' gerefa ' ' should end as a subservient reeve , the ' ' Graf ' ' as a noble count . # Feudalism # In the feudal tradition , Latin was often used , especially in legal documents , as ( sometimes sole ) official language , so the rendering in Latin was no less important than the original in the spoken vernacular . Thus , ' ' comes ' ' has been used as the Latin equivalent ( or part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether containing Count ( or some other word etymologically derived from Comes , or in many other languages from Graf ) . *Similarly it is part of the rendering ( not always exclusive ) of derived lower titles containing such term , notably ' ' Vicecomes ' ' for Viscount and ' ' Burgicomes ' ' ( alongside ' ' burgravio ' ' ) for Burgrave.
