@@33196514 Following is a sampling of some of NASA 's past and present programs excluding manned spacecraft . The years in brackets are for first and latest launching . A program is a number of flights or missions with the same kind of satellite , therefore the name of the program and the name of the satellite used will often be the same . In all NASA have made more than 1,000 unmanned missions into Earth orbit or beyond . # List of programs # # Explorer program ( 1958 ) # The Explorer program continues and over more than five decades has launched 90+ missions into Space . It has matured into one of NASA 's lower-cost mission programs , relative to its other programs . It began as a U.S. Army proposal to place a scientific satellite into orbit during the International Geophysical Year ( 195758 ) ; however , that proposal was rejected in favor of the U.S. Navy 's Project Vanguard . The Explorer program was later reestablished to catch up with the Soviet Union after that nation 's launch of Sputnik 1 on October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1958 ; at this time the project still belonged to ABMA and JPL . Besides being the first U.S. satellite , it is known for discovering the Van Allen radiation belt . The Explorer program was transferred to NASA , which continued to use the name for an ongoing series of relatively small space missions , typically an artificial satellite with a science focus . Over the years , NASA has launched a series of Explorer spacecraft carrying a wide variety of scientific investigations . # Pioneer program ( 19581978 ) # The Pioneer program is a series of NASA unmanned space missions that was designed for planetary exploration . There were a number of such missions in the program , but the most notable were Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 , which explored the outer planets and left the solar system . Both carry a golden plaque , depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes , should any extraterrestrials find them someday . Additionally , the Pioneer mission to Venus consisted of two components , launched separately . Pioneer Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the planet for more than a decade after orbital insertion in 1978 . Pioneer Venus 2 or Pioneer Venus Multiprobe sent four small probes into the Venusian atmosphere . # Echo Project ( 19601964 ) # Project Echo was the first passive communications satellite experiment . Each spacecraft was a metalized balloon satellite to be inflated in space and acting as a passive reflector of microwave signals . Communication signals were bounced off of them from one-point on Earth to another . NASA 's Echo 1 satellite was built by Gilmore Schjeldahl Company in Northfield , Minnesota . Following the failure of the Delta rocket carrying Echo 1 on May 13 , 1960 , Echo 1A was put successfully into a 944 to 1,048 mi orbit by another Thor-Delta and a microwave transmission from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California was received at Bell Laboratories in Homdel , New Jersey on August 12 , 1960 . Echo 2 was a 41.1-meter ( 135 ft ) diameter metalized PET film balloon , which was the last balloon satellite launched by Project Echo . It used an improved inflation system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was launched January 25 , 1964 on a Thor Agena rocket . # Ranger program ( 19611965 ) # The Ranger program was a series of unmanned space missions by the United States in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the Moon . The Ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface , returning those images until they were destroyed upon impact . A series of mishaps , however , led to the failure of the first six flights . At one point , the program was called shoot and hope . Congress launched an investigation into problems of management at NASA Headquarters and Jet Propulsion Laboratory . After reorganizing the organization twice , Ranger 7 successfully returned images in July 1964 , followed by two more successful missions . Ranger was originally designed , beginning in 1959 , in three distinct phases , called blocks . Each block had different mission objectives and progressively more advanced system design . The JPL mission designers planned multiple launches in each block , to maximize the engineering experience and scientific value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight . Total research , development , launch , and support costs for the Ranger series of spacecraft ( Rangers 1 through 9 ) was approximately $170 million . # Telstar ( 19621963 , commercial project with NASA contribution ) # Telstar was not a NASA program but a commercial communication satellite project . NASA 's contribution to it was limited to launch services , as well as tracking and telemetry duties . The first two Telstar satellites were experimental and nearly identical . Telstar 1 was launched on top of a Thor-Delta rocket on July 10 , 1962 . It successfully relayed through space the first television pictures , telephone calls , fax images and provided the first live transatlantic television feed . Telstar 2 was launched May 7 , 1963 . Bell Telephone Laboratories designed and built the Telstar satellite . They were prototypes intended to prove various concepts behind the large constellation of orbiting satellites . The faceted 171 lb ( 77 kg ) sphere had a diameter of a little more than 34 inches ( about 1 m ) . Bell Telephone Laboratories also developed much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar cells , and traveling wave tube amplifiers . To handle Telstar communications , AT&amp;T built ground stations at Andover , Maine ; Pleumeur-Bodou , France ; and Goonhilly Downs , Britain . These were similar to , but larger than , the ground station used for project Echo . Telstar was a technical success . A US . Information Agency ( USIA ) poll showed that Telstar was better known in Great Britain than Sputnik had been in 1957 . In contrast to Sputnik , Telstar 's signals were useful . # Mariner program ( 19631973 ) # The Mariner program conducted by NASA launched a series of robotic interplanetary probes designed to investigate Mars , Venus and Mercury . The program included a number of firsts , including the first planetary flyby , the first pictures from another planet , the first planetary orbiter , and the first gravity assist maneuver . Of the ten vehicles in the Mariner series , seven were successful and three were lost . The planned Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 vehicles evolved into Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 of the Voyager program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged versions of the Mariner 9 spacecraft . Other Mariner-based spacecraft , launched since Voyager , included the Magellan probe to Venus , and the Galileo probe to Jupiter . A second-generation Mariner spacecraft , called the Mariner Mark II series , eventually evolved into the CassiniHuygens probe , now in orbit around Saturn . All Mariner spacecraft were based on a hexagonal or octagonal bus , which housed all of the electronics , and to which all components were attached , such as antennae , cameras , propulsion , and power sources . All probes except Mariner 1 , Mariner 2 and Mariner 5 had TV cameras . The first five Mariners were launched on Atlas-Agena rockets , while the last five used the Atlas-Centaur . All Mariner-based probes after Mariner 10 used the Titan IIIE , Titan IV unmanned rockets or the Space Shuttle with a solid-fueled Inertial Upper Stage and multiple planetary flybys. # Surveyor program ( 19661968 ) # The Surveyor Program was a NASA program that , from 1966 through 1968 , sent seven robotic spacecraft to the surface of the Moon . Its primary goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon . The mission called for the craft to travel directly to the moon on an impact trajectory ( no orbit first ) , on a journey that lasted 63 to 65 hours , and ended with a deceleration of just over three minutes to a soft-landing . The program was implemented by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) to prepare for the Apollo program . The total cost of the Surveyor program was officially $469 million . Five of the Surveyor craft successfully soft-landed on the moon , including the first one . Two failed : Surveyor 2 crashed at high velocity after a failed mid-course correction , and Surveyor 4 was lost for contact ( possibly exploding ) 2.5 minutes before its scheduled touch-down . All seven spacecraft are still on the Moon ; none of the missions included returning them to Earth . Some parts of Surveyor 3 were returned to Earth by the crew of Apollo 12 , which landed near it in 1969 . The camera from this craft is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helios II space probes , also known as Helios-A and Helios-B , were a pair of probes launched into heliocentric orbit for the purpose of studying solar processes . A joint venture of the Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) and NASA , the probes were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Florida , on Dec 10 , 1974 , and Jan 15 , 1976 , respectively . The probes are notable for setting a maximum speed record among spacecraft at /h ( 157,078 mi/h or 43.63 mi/s or /s or 0.000234c ) . The Helios space probes completed their primary missions by the early 1980s , but they continued to send data up to 1985 . The probes are no longer functional but still remain in their elliptical orbit around the Sun . # Viking program ( 1975 ) # The Viking program consisted of a pair of space probes sent to MarsViking 1 and Viking 2 . Each vehicle was composed of two main parts , an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of Mars from orbit , and a lander designed to study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication relays for the landers once they touched down . Viking 1 was launched on August 20 , 1975 , and the second craft , Viking 2 , was launched on September 9 , 1975 , both riding atop Titan III-E rockets with Centaur upper stages . By discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water , the Viking program caused a revolution in scientific ideas about water on Mars . The primary objectives of the Viking orbiters were to transport the landers to Mars , perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites , act as a communications relays for the landers , and to perform their own scientific investigations . The orbiter , based on the earlier Mariner 9 spacecraft , was an octagon approximately 2.5m ft across . The total launch mass was , of which were propellant and attitude control gas . # Voyager program ( 1977 ) # The Voyager program is a series of NASA unmanned space missions that consists of a pair of unmanned scientific probes , Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 . They were launched in 1977 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s . Although they were officially designated to study just Jupiter and Saturn , the two probes were able to continue their mission into the outer solar system . Both probes have achieved escape velocity from the solar system and will never return . Both missions have gathered large amounts of data about the gas giants of the solar system , of which little was previously known . , Voyager 1 was at a distance of 115.251 AU ( 17.242 billion km , or 10.712 billion miles ) , traveling away from both the Earth and the Sun at a speed of /s , which corresponds to a greater specific orbital energy than any other probe . # High Energy Astronomy Observatory 1 ( 1977 ) # The first of NASA 's three High Energy Astronomy Observatories , HEAO 1 , launched August 12 , 1977 aboard an Atlas rocket with a Centaur upper stage , operated until January 9 , 1979 . During that time , it scanned the X-ray sky almost three times over 0.2 keV 10 MeV , provided nearly constant monitoring of X-ray sources near the ecliptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of objects through pointed observations . HEAO included four large X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy instruments , known as A1 , A2 , A3 , and A4 , respectively ( before launch , HEAO 1 was known as HEAO A ) . The orbital inclination was about 22.7 degrees . HEAO 1 re-entered the Earth 's atmosphere on March 15 , 1979. # Solar Maximum Mission ( 1980 ) # The Solar Maximum Mission satellite ( or SolarMax ) was designed to investigate solar phenomenon , particularly solar flares . It was launched on February 14 , 1980 . Although not unique in this endeavor , the SMM was notable in that its useful life compared with similar spacecraft was significantly increased by the direct intervention of a manned space mission . During STS-41-C in 1984 , the Space Shuttle Challenger intercepted the SMM , maneuvering it into the shuttle 's payload bay for maintenance and repairs . SMM had been fitted with a shuttle grapple fixture so that the shuttle 's robot arm could grab it for repair . The mission was depicted in the 1985 IMAX movie The Dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , 1989 , when the spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere and burned up . # Infrared Astronomical Satellite , IRAS ( 1983 ) # The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) was the first-ever space-based observatory to perform a survey of the entire sky at infrared wavelengths . It discovered about 350,000 sources , many of which are still awaiting identification . New discoveries included a dust disk around Vega and the first images of the Milky Way Galaxy 's core . IRAS 's life , like that of most of infrared satellites that followed after , was limited by its cooling system . To effectively work in the infrared domain , the telescope must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures . In IRAS 's case , 73 kilograms of superfluid helium kept the telescope at a temperature of 2 kelvins ( about 271 C ) by evaporation . The supply of liquid helium was depleted after 10 months on November 22 , 1983 , causing the telescope temperature to rise and preventing further observations . The spacecraft continues to orbit close to the earth . The telescope was a joint project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NIVR ) , and the United Kingdom ( SERC ) . Over 250,000 infrared sources were observed at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 micrometer wavelengths. # Magellan probe ( 1989 ) # The Magellan spacecraft was a space probe sent to the planet Venus , the first unmanned interplanetary spacecraft to be launched by NASA since its successful Pioneer Orbiter , also to Venus , in 1978 . It was also the first of three deep-space probes to be launched on the Space Shuttle , and the first spacecraft to employ aerobraking techniques to lower its orbit . Magellan created the first ( and currently the best ) high resolution mapping of the planet 's surface features . Prior Venus missions had created low resolution radar globes of general , continent-sized formations . Magellan , performed detailed imaging and analysis of craters , hills , ridges , and other geologic formations , to a degree comparable to the visible-light photographic mapping of other planets . # Galileo probe ( 1989 ) # Galileo was an unmanned spacecraft sent by NASA to study the planet Jupiter and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-34 mission . It arrived at Jupiter on December 7 , 1995 , a little more than six years later , via gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth . Despite antenna problems , Galileo conducted the first asteroid flyby , discovered the first asteroid moon , was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter , and launched the first probe into Jupiter 's atmosphere . Galileo 's prime mission was a two-year study of the Jovian system . The spacecraft traveled around Jupiter in elongated ellipses , each orbit lasting about two months . The differing distances from Jupiter afforded by these orbits allowed Galileo to sample different parts of the planet 's extensive magnetosphere . The orbits were designed for close up flybys of Jupiter 's largest moons . Once Galileo 's prime mission was concluded , an extended mission followed starting on December 7 , 1997 ; the spacecraft made a number of daring close flybys of Jupiter 's moons Europa and Io . The closest approach was ( 112 mi ) on October 15 , 2001 . On September 21 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service in the Jovian system ( around Jupiter ) , Galileo 's mission was terminated by sending the orbiter into Jupiter 's atmosphere at a speed of nearly 50 kilometers per second . The program 's funding was running out and the spacecraft was low on propellant ; in addition , many systems were damaged . One of the reasons given for its destruction was to avoid the chance of it contaminating local moons with bacteria from Earth . Of particular interest was the ice-crusted moon Europa , which , thanks to Galileo , scientists now suspect harbors a salt water ocean beneath its surface . # Hubble Space Telescope ( 1990 ) # The Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) is a space telescope that was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in April 1990 . It is named after American astronomer Edwin Hubble . Although not the first space telescope , Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile , and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy . The HST is a collaboration between NASA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Great Observatories , along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope . The HST 's success has paved the way for greater collaboration between the agencies . The HST was created with a relatively small budget of $2 billion and has continued operation since 1990 , delighting both scientists and the public . Some of its images , such as the groundbreaking Hubble Deep Field , have become famous . # Ulysses ( 1990 ) # Ulysses is a decommissioned robotic space probe that was designed to study the Sun as a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) . Due to the loss of Challenger , the launch of Ulysses was delayed until October 6 , 1990 aboard ' ' Discovery ' ' ( mission STS-41 ) . The spacecraft 's mission was to study the Sun at all latitudes . To do this required a major orbital plane shift . Due to velocity change limitations of the Shuttle and the Inertial Upper Stage ( IUS ) , this was accomplished by using an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engine burn . The need for a Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells and was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator ( RTG ) instead . By February 2008 , the power output from the RTG , which is generated by heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238 , had decreased enough to leave insufficient power for internal heaters to keep the spacecraft 's attitude control hydrazine fuel from freezing . The end of mission was at one-point scheduled for July 1 , 2008 , but mission scientists came up with a method to keep the fuel liquid by conducting a short thruster burn every two hours , allowing the mission to continue . The cessation of mission operations and deactivation or hibernation of the spacecraft was determined by the inability to prevent attitude control fuel from freezing . The last day for mission operations on Ulysses was June 30 , 2009. # Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite , UARS ( 1991 ) # UARS is a science satellite used from 1991 to 2005 to study Earth 's atmosphere , including the ozone layer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable , allowing extended observation from its instrument suite . It was launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery and deployed into space from the payload bay with its robotic arm , under guidance from the crew . The satellite was expected to undergo atmospheric re-entry in the late evening of Friday September 23 , 2011 or early morning of Saturday September 24 , 2011 , Eastern Daylight Time . On 24 September 2011 1:09 am EDT UARS made its re-entry . At around about 6 tonnes , it was the heaviest NASA satellite to undergo uncontrolled atmospheric entry since Skylab in the summer 1979 , which was roughly 70 tonnes . It is heavier than Pegasus 2 , which fell back in fall of 1979 , but weighed less than 2 tonnes . # Discovery Program ( 19922011 ) # NASA 's Discovery Program ( as compared to New Frontiers , Explorers , or Flagship Programs ) is a series of lower-cost , highly-focused American scientific space missions that are exploring the Solar System . It was founded in 1992 to implement then-NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin 's vision of faster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional NASA missions where targets and objectives are pre-specified . Instead , these cost-capped missions are proposed and led by a scientist called the Principal Investigator ( PI ) . Proposing teams may include people from industry , small businesses , government laboratories , and universities . Proposals are selected through a competitive peer review process . All of the completed Discovery missions are accomplishing ground-breaking science and adding significantly to the body of knowledge about the Solar System . NASA also accepts proposals for competitively selected Discovery Program Missions of Opportunity . This provides opportunities to participate in non-NASA missions by providing funding for a science instrument or hardware components of a science instrument or to re-purpose an existing NASA spacecraft . These opportunities are currently offered through NASA 's Stand Alone Mission of Opportunity program . Examples of missions are Mars Pathfinder , Kepler , Stardust , Genesis and Deep Impact . The Mars Pathfinder ( MESUR Pathfinder , ) later renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station , was launched on December 4 , 1996 , just a month after the Mars Global Surveyor was launched . On board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute many experiments on the Martian surface . It was the second project from NASA 's Discovery Program , which promotes the use of low-cost spacecraft and frequent launches under the motto cheaper , faster and better promoted by the then administrator , Daniel Goldin . The mission was directed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology , responsible for NASA 's Mars Exploration Program . Kepler is a space observatory launched by NASA to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars . The spacecraft , named in honor of the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler , was launched in March 2009 . Stardust is a 300-kilogram robotic space probe launched by NASA on February 7 , 1999 to study the asteroid 5535 Annefrank and collect samples from the coma of comet Wild 2 . The primary mission was completed January 15 , 2006 , when the sample return capsule returned to Earth . Operating for , Stardust intercepted comet Tempel 1 on February 15 , 2011 , a small Solar System body previously visited by Deep Impact on July 4 , 2005 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return the sample to Earth and the first to acquire images of a previously visited comet . The Genesis spacecraft was a NASA sample return probe which collected a sample of solar wind and returned it to Earth for analysis . It was the first NASA sample return mission to return material since the Apollo Program , and the first to return material from beyond the orbit of the Moon . Genesis was launched on August 8 , 2001 , and crash-landed in Utah on September 8 , 2004 , after a design flaw prevented the deployment of its drogue parachute . The crash contaminated many of the sample collectors , but although most were damaged , many of the collectors were successfully recovered . Deep Impact is a NASA space probe launched on January 12 , 2005 . It was designed to study the composition of the comet interior of 9P/Tempel , by releasing an impactor into the comet . At 5:52 UTC on July 4 , 2005 , the impactor successfully collided with the comet 's nucleus . The impact excavated debris from the interior of the nucleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected . # Clementine ( 1994 ) # Clementine ( officially called the Deep Space Program Science Experiment ( DSPSE ) was a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization ( BMDO , previously the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization , or SDIO ) and NASA . Launched on January 25 , 1994 , the objective of the mission was to test sensors and spacecraft components under extended exposure to the space environment and to make scientific observations of the Moon and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos . The Geographos observations were not made due to a malfunction in the spacecraft . # Mars Global Surveyor ( 1996 ) # The Mars Global Surveyor ( MGS ) was developed by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched November 1996 . It began the United States ' return to Mars after a 10-year absence . It completed its primary mission in January 2001 and was in its third extended mission phase when , on November 2 , 2006 , the spacecraft failed to respond to commands . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacecraft used a series of high-resolution cameras to explore the surface of Mars during its mission , returning more than 240,000 images spanning portions of 4.8 Martian years , from September 1997 to November 2006 . The surveyor 's cameras utilized 3 instruments : a narrow angle camera that took ( black-and-white ) high resolution images ( usually 1.5 to 12 m per pixel ) red and blue wide angle pictures for context ( 240 m per pixel ) and daily global imaging ( per pixel ) . # CassiniHuygens ( 1997 ) # CassiniHuygens is a joint NASA/ESA/ASI spacecraft mission studying the planet Saturn and its many natural satellites . It includes a Saturn orbiter and an atmospheric probe/lander for the moon Titan , although it has also returned data on a wide variety of other things including the Heliosphere , Jupiter , and relativity tests . The Titan probe , ' ' Huygens ' ' , entered and landed on Titan in 2005 . ' ' Cassini ' ' is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit , with its mission ongoing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Titan IVB/Centaur and entered into orbit around Saturn on July 1 , 2004 , after an interplanetary voyage which included flybys of Earth , Venus , and Jupiter . On December 25 , 2004 , ' ' Huygens ' ' separated from the orbiter at approximately 02:00 UTC . It reached Saturn 's moon Titan on January 14 , 2005 , when it entered Titan 's atmosphere and descended downward to the surface . It successfully returned data to Earth , using the orbiter as a relay . This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System . Sixteen European countries and the United States make up the team responsible for designing , building , flying and collecting data from the Cassini orbiter and Huygens probe . The mission is managed by NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States , where the orbiter was assembled . Huygens was developed by the European Space Research and Technology Centre , whose prime contractor was Alcatel of France . Equipment and instruments for the probe were supplied by many countries . # New Millennium Program ( 19982006 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project with focus on engineering validation of new technologies for space applications . Funding for the program was eliminated from the FY2009 budget by the 110th United States Congress , effectively leading to its cancellation . The spacecraft in the New Millennium Program were originally named Deep Space ( for missions demonstrating technology for planetary missions ) and Earth Observing ( for missions demonstrating technology for Earth orbiting missions ) . With a refocussing of the program in 2000 , the Deep Space series was renamed Space Technology . Deep Space 1 ( DS1 ) is a spacecraft dedicated to testing a payload of advanced , high risk technologies . Launched on October 24 , 1998 , the Deep Space mission carried out a flyby of asteroid 9969 Braille , which was selected as the mission 's science target . Its mission was extended twice to include an encounter with Comet Borrelly and further engineering testing . Problems during its initial stages and with its star tracker led to repeated changes in mission configuration . While the flyby of the asteroid was a partial success , the encounter with the comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to work within a few minutes of separation from the carrier rocket for the mission to continue . The Deep Space series was continued by the Deep Space 2 probes , which were launched in January 1999 on Mars Polar Lander and were intended to strike the surface of Mars . Deep Space 1 was the first spacecraft to use Ion powered rocketry , in contrast to the traditional chemical powered rockets . # Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( 2002 ) # The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) , a joint mission of NASA and the German Aerospace Center , has been making detailed measurements of Earth 's gravity field since its launch in March 2002 . The satellites were launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome , Russia on a Rockot ( SS-19 + Breeze upper stage ) launch vehicle . By measuring gravity , GRACE shows how mass is distributed around the planet and how it varies over time . Data from the GRACE satellites is an important tool for studying Earth 's ocean , geology , and climate . GRACE is a collaborative endeavor involving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin ; NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. ; the German Space Agency and Germany 's National Research Center for Geosciences , Potsdam . The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is responsible for the overall mission management under the NASA ESSP program . The principal investigator is Dr. Byron Tapley of the University of Texas Center for Space Research , and the co-principal investigator is Dr. Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum ( GFZ ) Potsdam . # Earth Observing System ( 19972011 ) # The Earth Observing System ( EOS ) is a program of NASA comprising a series of artificial satellite missions and scientific instruments in Earth orbit designed for long-term global observations of the land surface , biosphere , atmosphere , and oceans of the Earth . The satellite component of the program was launched in 1997 . The program is centerpiece of NASA 's Earth Science Enterprise ( ESE ) . Mission examples are : SeaWiFS ( 1997 ) , Landsat 7 ( 1999 ) , QuikSCAT ( 1999 ) , Jason 1 ( 2001 ) , GRACE ( 2002 ) , Aqua ( 2002 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars Exploration Rovers ( 2003 ) # NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Mission ( MER ) , is an ongoing robotic space mission involving two rovers exploring the planet Mars . The mission is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , which designed , built and is operating the rovers . The mission began in 2003 with the sending of the two roversMER-A Spirit and MER-B Opportunityto explore the Martian surface and geology . The mission 's scientific objective is to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars . The mission is part of NASA 's Mars Exploration Program which includes three previous successful landers : the two Viking program landers in 1976 and Mars Pathfinder probe in 1997 . The total cost of building , launching , landing and operating the rovers on the surface for the initial 90-Martian-day ( sol ) primary mission was US$820 million . Since the rovers continued to function far beyond their initial 90 sol primary mission ( six years to failure for Spirit , eight years and counting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # MESSENGER ( 2004 ) # MESSENGER ( an acronym of MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry , and Ranging ) is a robotic spacecraft orbiting the planet Mercury , the first spacecraft ever to do so . The 485 kg spacecraft was launched aboard a Delta II rocket in August 2004 to study Mercury 's chemical composition , geology , and magnetic field . MESSENGER became the second mission after Mariner 10 to reach Mercury when it made a flyby in January 2008 , followed by a second flyby in October 2008 , and a third flyby in September 2009 . Then MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury on March 18 , 2011 . The instruments carried by MESSENGER were used on that complex series of flybys the spacecraft flew by Earth once , Venus twice , and Mercury itself three times , allowing it to decelerate relative to Mercury using minimal fuel . When MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury on March 18 , 2011 , it then reactivated its science instruments on March 24 , returning the first photo from Mercury orbit on March 29. # New Frontiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of space exploration missions being conducted by NASA with the purpose of researching several of the Sun 's planets including Jupiter , Venus , and the dwarf planet Pluto . NASA is encouraging both domestic and international scientists to submit mission proposals for the project . New Frontiers was built on the innovative approach used by the Discovery and Explorer Programs of principal investigator-led missions . It is designed for medium-class missions that can not be accomplished within the cost and time constraints of Discovery , but are not as large as Flagship-class missions . There are currently two New Frontiers missions in progress , New Horizons which launched on January 19 , 2006 , and Juno which launched on August 5 , 2011 ; a third New Frontiers mission , OSIRIS-REx , has been selected for launch in 2016. # Mars Scout Program ( 20072008 ) # The Mars Scout Program was a NASA initiative to send a series of small , low-cost robotic missions to Mars , competitively selected from innovative proposals by the scientific community . The program had an array of missions destined to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each Scout project was to cost less than US$485 million . The Phoenix lander and MAVEN orbiter were selected and developed before the program was retired in 2010 . Phoenix was a lander originally intended for the canceled Mars Surveyor mission but adapted to the new mission . Phoenix was launched on August 4 , 2007 , and landed in the icy northern polar region of the planet on May 25 , 2008 . Phoenix was designed to search for environments suitable for microbial life on Mars , and to research the history of water there . The 90-day primary mission was successful and the overall mission was concluded on November 10 , 2008 , after engineers were unable to contact the craft . The lander last made a brief communication with Earth on November 2 , 2008. # Dawn ( 2007 ) # Dawn is a NASA spacecraft tasked with the exploration and study of the asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres , the two largest members of the asteroid belt . The spacecraft was constructed with some European cooperation , with components contributed by partners in Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' mission is managed by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory . ' ' Dawn ' ' will be the first spacecraft to visit either Vesta or Ceres . It may furthermore be the first spacecraft to orbit two separate extraterrestrial bodies , using ion thrusters to travel between its targets . Previous multi-target missions using conventional drives , such as the ' ' Voyager ' ' program , were restricted to flybys . Launched on September 27 , 2007 , ' ' Dawn ' ' entered orbit around Vesta on July 16 , 2011 , and will explore it until August 26 , 2012 . Thereafter , the spacecraft will head to Ceres , which it is scheduled to reach in February 2015 . ' ' Dawn ' ' is NASAs first purely exploratory mission to use ion propulsion. # Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( 2009 ) # The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) is a NASA robotic spacecraft currently orbiting the Moon on a low polar mapping orbit . The LRO mission is a precursor to future manned missions to the Moon by NASA . To this end a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential resources on the Moon , characterize the radiation environment , and demonstrate new technology . The probe will make a 3-D map of the Moon 's surface and has provided some of the first images of Apollo equipment left on the Moon . The first images from LRO were published on July 2 , 2009 , showing a region in the lunar highlands south of Mare Nubium ( ' ' Sea of Clouds ' ' ) . Launched on June 18 , 2009 , in conjunction with the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) , as the vanguard of NASA 's Lunar Precursor Robotic Program , this is the first United States mission to the Moon in over ten years . LRO and LCROSS are the first missions launched as part of the United States 's Vision for Space Exploration program . # Mars Science Laboratory ( 2011 ) # Mars Science Laboratory ( MSL ) is a NASA mission to land and operate a rover named Curiosity on the surface of Mars . It was launched November 26 , 2011 and landed successfully on August 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crater near Aeolis Mons ( formerly Mount Sharp ) . On Mars it will help assess Mars ' habitability . It can chemically analyze samples by scooping up soil and drill rocks using a laser and sensor system . The Curiosity rover is about five times larger than the Spirit or Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers and carries more than ten times the mass of scientific instruments . MSL was launched by an Atlas V 541 rocket and is designed to explore for at least 687 Earth days ( 1 Martian year ) over a range of 520 km ( 312 miles ) .
