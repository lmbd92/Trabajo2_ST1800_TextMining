@@24714514 Ogging is term for a tactic developed for the online multiplayer game ' ' Netrek ' ' . This game was among the very first multiplayer Internet based games , and was most popular in the 1990s on university Unix systems used for internet access , and is still played today , having been later adapted to Windows and Macintosh computers . The ogg is a kamikaze-style attack , frequently coordinated between multiple ships , with the goal of eliminating a target of high importance , generally with the idea that destroying the target is strategically more valuable than the survival of the attacking ships . It was typically used to destroy enemy ships carrying armies or as a coordinated multi-ship ogg against a starbase . According to the Jargon File , ogg was sometimes also used by extension in the context of other games or in real life . # Fake ogging # Often a player would cloak and make ogging-like movements if injured or in order to buy time until reinforcements arrived ; this was known as fake ogging . Fake ogging could also convince a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a diversion for a carrier to capture a planet or achieve some other team objective . # History # In the game , players are designated by two alphanumeric characters , where the first character represents the team and the second letter represents the individual designation of that player . There are four teams , Federation , Klingon , Romulan , and Orion , identified as F , K , R , and O , and 16 player slots , numbered 0-9 and then a-f ( hexadecimal numbering ) . Thus , for example , a player on the Federation team in the 11th of the 16 player slots would be designated Fb ( FED or Federation team , player B ) , or a player in the first slot who was playing on the Romulan team would be R0 ( ROM or Romulan team , player 0 ) . There were four reserved slots that could only be used by local administrators , identified with g-j ( these have since been reallocated for use by observers who wish to watch the game ) . While the game has four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the unused teams ' planets being used as part of the playing field . During a full game on a Netrek server at CMU during the 1990-91 school year , a member of the Federation team , Stephen Russell ( callsign Feakhelek ) , was heading into Romulan space to capture a planet . The server administrator , Terence Chang , came in on the first reserved slot on the otherwise-empty Orion team , thus being designated as Og . Instead of engaging in a dogfight , Chang charged in suicidally , failing to kill the Federation ship but leaving it badly damaged . When Og re-spawned , and again charged the now-crippled ship , the Fed player shouted to other people in the workstation cluster , Help , it 's oh-gee ! , followed by cries of It 's ogg ! It 's ogg ! Help ! . The second suicide attack worked , prompting the Fed player to broadcast Arrrgh , I was Og'ed on the in-game message system . # References # <references/> *
